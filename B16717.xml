            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                     <salute>SIR,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>THO' at our laſt parting, I found you obſtinate in your Unbelief, as to the matter of <hi>Purgatory,</hi> yet as I think my ſelf bound both as a Chriſtian, and as a Friend, to combate that dangerous Infidelity of yours, ſo I ſhall now undertake that Province with ſome new Efforts: Nevertheleſs I will not venture to Engage you ſingly with my own ſtrength, but borrow the neceſſary forces from ſuch as have been moſt vers'd in ſuch ſort of Conflicts. Wherefore to begin, I muſt tell you That your Repartées upon me when we laſt diſcours'd this point, rather ſpoke the Libertine than a Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor of Chriſtianity. <hi>Purgatory</hi> (you deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly cry'd) <hi>is not ſo hot as Folk talk. Who</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:47928:3"/> 
                     <hi>ever came back to tell us News of it? God is mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful; think you he takes delight to burn his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and to cut off the Price of his Son's Paſſion, who ſatisfied for our Sin.</hi> When I heard this I was afraid you would have proceeded and joyn'd with Atheiſtical Philoſophers, in ſaying, <hi>That Death is the Remedy of all Evils, and that tht Soul ſeparated from the Body hath no more to ſuffer.</hi> What could I leſs expect, when you ſo diametrically oppoſe not only the General Conſent of all Ages, but alſo the General Opinion Practice, Sentence, and deciſions of all the Church, in ſuch ſort, That there is not any Truth of our Faith more fortified.</p>
                  <p>As to the Firſt, the Gentiles who lived out of the Law, were ſenſible of the noble extraction of the Soul, and knew it to be defiled by the Body, and by ſenſual Works. On this account had they recourſe to feeble Elements to purifie it: One while waſhing themſelves in virgin-ſtreams, another paſſing thro? Flames, and ſometimes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triving other means to cleanſe themſelves from the Pollutions of the Fleſh. And they were not content to purge themſelves in this Life, but extend it to the Souls of the Dead, conſtantly believing they ſtood in need of Remedies to free themſelves from Bodily ſtains. The <hi>Hebrews</hi> the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:47928:3"/> 
                     <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> the <hi>Greeians</hi> and <hi>Romans</hi> all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for Prayers for the Dead and the Truth of <hi>Purgatory.</hi> The <hi>Hebrews</hi> three times in the Year Celebrated the Feaſt of the Dead, and their Prieſt mounting up into a Four-ſquare Pulpit made on purpoſe and Ceremoniouſly to repreſent the City of the Bleſſed, according to S. <hi>John,</hi> rehearſed aloud and <note place="margin">Apoc. xxi 16. <hi>Civitas in qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dro poſitas eſt.</hi>
                     </note> audibly the Names of the Dead, to recommend them to the Prayers of the preſent Congregation. Prayers ſo familiar amongſt them, that they wrote them upon Tombs, inſtead of Epitaphs, in theſe terms: Sit Anima ejus colligata in Faſciculo viventium. <hi>Let his Soul be bound up in the Poſie of the Living.</hi> As if we ſhould ſay, all the Souls of the Saints were as an odoriferous Poſie, whereof every Elect conſtituted a Flower.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Aegyptians</hi> were ſo poſſeſſed with the Opinion that Souls were to be purg'd in the other Life, in as much as they had been drench'd in the voluptuous Pleaſures of the Fleſh, that in the Funerals of the Dead, having opened the Body, they took the Heart out of the Breaſt, and put it into a little Casket, then on the Bank of <hi>Nilus,</hi> where ordinarily Tombs were erected, a Herald holding the Casket, and ſhewing
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:47928:4"/> it to the Eyes of Heaven, proteſted before all then preſent, the Deceaſed now in Queſtion had lived piouſly, and according to the Laws of his Anceſtors; that if he had offended through Bodily Pleaſures, they wiſhed his Soul might be as well cleanſed, as they went about to purge the Stomach, the Inſtrument of the Luſts of the Living, thereupon they threw it into <hi>Nilus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What need I mention the <hi>Grecians,</hi> their Prime Man <hi>Plato,</hi> nay termed the <hi>Divine,</hi> in his <hi>Phaedon</hi> ſpake ſo perſpicuouſly for <hi>Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory,</hi> that he ſeems to have had his Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation in Chriſtian Schools. And as for the <hi>Romans, Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilian</hi> in the very Infancy of <note place="margin">Quint. <hi>Declam.</hi> 10.</note> the Church, when as ſome of the Apoſtles were yet living, in a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Plea. urges the Truth of <hi>Purgatory</hi> by ſaying, <hi>The Soul being purged by Fire, went to take place in Heaven.</hi> Beſides <hi>Julius,</hi> a very ancient Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, ſpeaking of the Death <note place="margin">Julius, <hi>Florileg. lib.</hi> 3.</note> of a Lady named <hi>Podon,</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in plain terms, That her Husband, who was one of the moſt ancient Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, made Offerings for her, which he calls <hi>Gifts for Ranſom of the Soul:</hi> Anſwerable to which <hi>Tertullian</hi> writeth, it was the Cuſtom

                     </note> Dead, yea, and to make annual Offerings for them.</p>
                  <p>Thus when we ſee a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> Univerſal Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in a Propoſition, it is not one man ſpeaks, but the Mouth of Heaven, which uttereth this Verity. And alſo obſerve when the Holy Fathers produce an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of <hi>Pagans,</hi> it is not to ſet us the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans</hi> for our Inſtruction, but to ſhew, that to waver in the Belief of things they ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally held by the ſentence of Nature, is to be worſe than a <hi>Pagan.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Having thus proved the Univerſal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of all Ages and Countries, I now pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to ſhew it to have ever been the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal ſenſe of the Church.

                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:47928:5"/>
                  <p> Ay but you object, That <hi>Jeſus</hi> made Purgation of Sins, and ſaid to the Good Thief, <hi>Thou ſhalt to day be with me in Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice.</hi> A goodly Conſequence! Jeſus <hi>purged Sins, there is then no</hi> Purgatory! Might you not as well ſay <hi>Jeſus</hi> pray'd for Remiſſion of our Sins, then we no longer ſtand in need of Prayer or Penance. Beſides you would ſeem to intimate by ſaying, the Good Thief went directly to <hi>Paradice</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out feeling <hi>Purgatory,</hi> that we aſſert it was neceſſary for all the World to paſs that way. No, make your Self a great Saint, and the Purifying Flames will have nothing to work on. But you ſay this Doctrine came but lately into the World, and is the Invention of Self intercſted Pfieſts; But conſult the Scripture and the Fathers, and they will ſatisfie you to the contrary.</p>
                  <p>When St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid that the day of God, <hi>(viz.)</hi> the day of Judgment, be it general or particular, ſhall be mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted by Fire which ſhall put every One's Works <note place="margin">1 Cor. 3. <hi>Chap.</hi>

<pb n="7" facs="tcp:47928:5"/> of <hi>Purgatory,</hi> unleſs you be more illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted than S. <hi>Baſil,</hi> and S. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> who have judged it ſo, for the firſt ſaith, <hi>He threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the Soul not with Deſtruction, but Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> And the other plainly expreſſeth, <hi>He ſpeaks of the Pains of Fire, which God had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to purifie Souls.</hi> And the objection is as frivolous to ſay, <hi>as by fire,</hi> and not by fire; as when S. <hi>John</hi> wrote in the firſt Chapter of his Goſpel, <hi>That Men ſaw</hi> Jeſus <hi>as the only Son of God,</hi> that he were only a Figure of it, not a Truth; or as when S. <hi>Paul</hi> wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſeth, <hi>he was found as a man,</hi> we might infer, he were no <note place="margin">2 Chap. to the <hi>Philip.</hi>

<pb n="9" facs="tcp:47928:6"/> thereof as an Article of our Belief. It de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendeth on the Prerogative of God's Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and the Miniſtry of Angels.</p>
                  <p>As for Puniſhments, it is moſt certain the firſt conſiſteth in ſuſpenſion from the ſight of God, a matter very dolorous to the Soul, which being out of the Body, and far abſented from its ſource, naturally deſireth to rejoyn it ſelf to God, and the leaſt retardation it feels from ſuch Felicity, is moſt ſenſible unto it. The ſecond is the pain of ſenſe which is exerciſed by Fire, and ſometimes alſo by other ways. If you ſay you cannot comprehend how a mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial thing worketh on a ſpiritual; I ask of you again, this Soul which is in your Body, is it of any other kind than thoſe in Purgatory? And yet ſee you not how it daily ſuffereth in the Body? See you not how all the Dolours of Mortal Fleſh re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound back again by a moſt neceſſary amorous Sympathy to the bottom of our Soul? Is it not true our Soul containeth in it the root of Underſtanding, and all ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Knowledge, framed and accompliſhed by help of the Bodies Organs? Is it not true that being in the Body it underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth and feeleth with dependance on the Body? And when ſeparated it certainly underſtandeth with independance of the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:47928:7"/> Body: And tho there is no more Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral organ, <hi>which is as the Chariot of feeling,</hi> yet ſurely God may by his Power ſupply the Organ of Body, and neceſſitate the Soul immediatly to feel the ſharpneſs of fire, as if it were ſtill in the Body. And further, the fire not being contrary of its nature to the Spirit, might for all that be choſen, and appointed by the ſingular Diſpoſition of Providence to be unto the Soul an Afflicting ſign, in that it repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenteth to it in its flames the Anger of an Offended God.</p>
                  <p>But hoping you are now prety well convinc'd of the Truth of our Doctrine in this point, I ſhall trouble you no farther at this time than with one Example of the Apparition of Souls in Purgatory<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But firſt let me mind you, that he who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves nothing above Nature, will not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve a God of Nature. How many Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary things are there, with whoſe effects Experience has made us acquainted, and yet of which God hideth the reaſons from us? Who can tell why the <hi>Theamede</hi> which is a kind of Adamant, draweth Iron on the one ſide, and repelleth it on the other? Why do the forked Branches of the Nut Tree, turn towards Mines of Gold and Silver? Why do Bees often die
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:47928:7"/> in the Hives after the Death of the Maſter of the Family, unleſs they be elſewhere tranſported? Why doth a dead Body caſt forth bloud in the preſence of the Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer? Why do certain Fountains in the current of their Waters, and in their Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour carry preſages of Seaſons, as that of <hi>Blomuza</hi> which waxeth red when the Country is menaced with War? Why has ſo many Noble Families certain ſigns, that never fails to happen, when ſome one of the Family is to dye? The Commerce of the living with the Spirits of the Dead, is a matter very Extraordinary, but not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to the <hi>Father of Spirits,</hi> who holdeth total Nature between his hands.</p>
                  <p>But to come to the point, Hiſtories tell us, the Apparition of Souls in Purgatory are ſo frequent, that he who would keep an account, may as ſoon number the Stars in the Skye, or leaves on the Trees. But as it is not fit to be too credulous in all may be ſaid there upon, ſo a man muſt be very impudent to deny all is ſpoken of it, and to oppoſe as well the Authority of ſo many great Perſonages, as the Memory of all Ages. Now for the preſent I ſhall only ſingle out one inſtance to you.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Peter</hi> of <hi>Clugny,</hi> ſurnamed the Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, and in his time eſteemed as the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:47928:8"/> Oracle of <hi>France,</hi> Who for his Warineſs and ſcrupulous Conſideration in theſe Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, cannot but be thought of unqueſtion'd Authority. He relateth how that in a Village of <hi>Spain</hi> named the <hi>Star,</hi> there was a Man of Quality called <hi>Peter</hi> of <hi>Engelbert,</hi> muſt eſteemed in the World for his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Parts, and abundant Riches.</p>
                  <p>Yet when in years coming to underſtand the Vanity of all Sublunary things, he withdrew into a Monaſtery of the Order of <hi>Clugny,</hi> there piouſly to ſpend the reſt of his Days, as the beſt Incenſe is ſaid to come from old Trees. He often talk'd of a Viſion he had had, which made the General of his Order, then in <hi>Spain,</hi> queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion him in the preſence of the Biſhops of <hi>Oleron</hi> and <hi>Oſma,</hi> and conjure him in the virtue of holy Obedience, to tell him punctually the truth touching the Viſion he had ſeen, whileſt he led a ſecular Life. And this man being very grave and very Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpect, accordingly did ſo to this effect.</p>
                  <p>At the time of <hi>Alphonſus</hi> the younger's Warres in <hi>Caſtile,</hi> in the perſuance of the Edict, I ſent one of my menial Servants, named <hi>Sancius</hi> into his Army. The Peace being made, and he disbanded, returning home he was ſoon ſeiz'd with a ſickneſs, which in few days took him away into
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:47928:8"/> the other World. He had the uſual Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequies done him, and about four Months after, as I lay one Night broad awake in my Bed, I perceived a Phantòme in the form of a man, who ſtirring up the aſhes of my hearth, opened the burning Coals, which made him the more eaſily to be ſeen. Altho I found my ſelf much ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rify'd with the ſight of this Ghoſt, God gave me the Courage to ask him who he was? and for what purpoſe he came thither to lay my hearth abroad. But he in a very low voice anſwered: <hi>Maſter, fear nothing I am your poor Servant</hi> Sancius, <hi>I go into</hi> Caſtile <hi>in the Company of many Soldiers to Expiate my ſins in the ſame Place where I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I couragiouſly reply'd, if the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God call you thither, to what purpoſe come you hither? Sir, ſaid he, take it not a miſs for it is not without the Divine permiſſion. I am in a ſtate not deſperate, &amp; wherein I may be helped by you, if you bear any good will towards me. Hereupon I required what his neceſſity was, and what ſecours he expected from me. You know Maſter, ſaid he, that a little before my Death you ſent me into a Place where men are not ordinarily ſanctified. Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, ill Example, Youth, and Temerity,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:47928:9"/> all conſpire againſt the Soul of a poor Soldier, who hath no Government. I committed many outrages during the late Warr, robbing and pilling even to the Goods of the Church, for which I am at this preſent grievouſly tormented. But Good Maſter, if you loved me alive as one of yours, forget me not after Death. I ask no part of your great Riches, but only your Prayers, and ſome Almes for my ſake, which will much aſſiſt to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigate my pains. My Miſtreſs oweth me about eight Francks upon a reckoning between her and me, let her beſtow it, not for my Body, which hath no need of it, but the comfort of my Soul, which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecteth it from your Charities.</p>
                  <p>This Diſcourſe embolden'd me, and made me more deſirous to entertain it, than to fear the Apparition. I demanded whether it could tell me any News of one of my Contry<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>men, named <hi>Peter D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>jaca,</hi> Who died a while ſince. To which he made anſwer, I need not trouble my ſelf with it, for he was already in the number of the Bleſſed, ſince the great Alms he gave in the laſt famine, had pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed Heaven for him. From thence I fell upon another Queſtion, and was Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious to know what had happened to a
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:47928:9"/> certain Judge, Whom I very well knew, and who had lately paſſed into the other Life. To which he replied, Sir, ſpeak not of that miſerable Man, for Hell poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſeth him through the Corruption of Juſtice, which he by damnable Practice Exerciced, having an honour and Soul ſaleable to the prejudice of his Conſcience. My Curioſity carried me higher, to En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire what became of King <hi>Alphonſus</hi> the Great, at which time I heard an other voice that came from a Window behind me, ſaying very diſtinctly, it is not of <hi>Sancius</hi> you muſt demand that, becauſe he as yet can ſay nothing to the ſtate of that Prince, but I may have more experience thereof than he. I deceaſing five years ago, and being preſent in an accident which gave me ſome Light of it. I was much ſurprized, Unexpectedly hearing this other Voice, and turning, ſaw by the help of the Moons brightneſs which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected into my Chamber, a Man leaning on my Window, whom I entreated to tell me where then King <hi>Alphonſus</hi> was. Whereto he replied, he well knew, that paſſing out of this Life, he had been much tormented, and that the Prayers of good Religious men much helped him, but he could not at this preſent ſay in what
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:47928:10"/> ſtate he was. Having ſpoaken thus much he turned towards <hi>Sancius,</hi> ſitting near the fire, ſaid, let us go, it is time we depart. At which <hi>Sancius</hi> making no other anſwer, ſpeedily roſe up and redoubled his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints with a Lamentable voice, ſaying; Sir, I entreat you once again remember me, and that my Miſtriſs perform the requeſt I made you.</p>
                  <p>The next day <hi>Engelbert</hi> underſtood from his Wife the Caſe to be ſo as the Spirit had told him, and with all Obſervation diſpoſed himſelf ſpeedily and charitably, to ſatisfy all was required.</p>
                  <p>Here I ſhall reſpit from further Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Inſtances, till ſuch time as I am ſenſible of the Operations of theſe: In the mean while believe me Sir, ſincerely</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p n="1">I. FIrſt then 'tis related that this <hi>Andro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyne,</hi> or <hi>Hermaphrodite,</hi> was a poor <hi>Engliſh</hi> or <hi>Germane</hi> Girl, they know not which, they ſtory it ſo differently. Nay ſome of theſe Gentlemen Reporters are ſo blinded that they'll tell you ſhe was an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Woman born at <hi>Mentz;</hi> and that ſhe having been Educated at ſeveral Univerſities, by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling her Sex, and oft changing her Name; (for they have given her more Names than either the Great <hi>Mogul,</hi> the Grand <hi>Seignior,</hi> or
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:47928:14"/> Emperor of <hi>Perſia,</hi> ever attributed to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves) for ſometimes they call her <hi>Agnes;</hi> and ſome ſay her Name was <hi>Iſabella,</hi> others <hi>Gilbert,</hi> others <hi>Jutte;</hi> and ſome call her <hi>Dorothy;</hi> but at laſt they will needs have it that ſhe took upon her the Name of <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Engliſh-</hi>man; in favor, forſooth, of a Gallant of hers that was that Country-man, and came with him from <hi>Athens</hi> (after having ſtudyed a while there) to <hi>Rome;</hi> where ſhe taught publickly in the Schools, for two years ſay ſome; others ſay ſix: where, for her know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in ſacred letters, ſhe had but few her equals; and none her ſuperiors: ſo that ſhe acquir'd ſo great renown there, by her reading and diſputing ſo learnedly and accutely, that after the deceaſe of <hi>Leo IV.</hi> ſay ſome, others <hi>Leo VI.</hi> ſhe was, by conſent of all, Choſen Pope. See here good Reader, a very fine plauſible Romantick Story at firſt entrance.</p>
                     <p n="2">
                        <hi>II.</hi> But here be pleaſed to take a few ſhort Remarks with thee, hereupon. Firſt then Note that ſome of them ſay ſhe was an <hi>Engliſh</hi> woman, born at <hi>Mentz;</hi> when as <hi>Mentz</hi> is a famous City, ſituate upon the <hi>Rhine</hi> in <hi>Germany.</hi> Then as to her ſtudying in <hi>Athens,</hi> as they formally ſtory it; you are to underſtand, upon the Authentic Teſtimonies of <hi>Zonaras</hi> and <hi>Cedrenus,</hi> that <hi>Athens</hi> was at that time ruin'd, and the whole Country over-run with Barbariſm,
<q>And Corn grew there where <hi>Athens</hi> ſtood.</q>
                        <pb n="3" facs="tcp:47928:14"/> and conſequently no more place of ſtudying there at that time, than there is now at S. <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cras</hi> Church. Then as to her being Choſen Pope after her ſo ſhort a time of Reſidence at <hi>Rome,</hi> 'tis like the reſt; for I'll aſſure thee, 'tis a certain truth, that from S. <hi>Peter</hi>'s time, to thoſe days, and after, till <hi>Formoſus,</hi> who was the Eighth Pope, after this pretended Pope <hi>JOAN;</hi> none were choſen Popes, that was not Educated from their Cradle, in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church; and was firſt made Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or Deacon-Cardinal. How then is it likely that an unknown Woman; of as uncertain an Origine and Country; and without any Order, or Teſtimony of her Life-paſt, ſhould attain to the higheſt Eccleſiaſtical Dignity in the whole World? Then laſtly, there was no Cuſtom of publick Reading or Diſputing at <hi>Rome</hi> in thoſe days neither.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. Then, in the next place, they tell you a very formal Story of her being got with Child; but here's the miſchief on't, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not agree by whom; ſome ſaying it was by one of her Servants, others ſay 'twas a certain Cardinal did the deed; and that ſhe being ignorant that ſhe was ſo far gone with Child, in the time of her Popedom, was brought to Bed in the open Street, going in Proceſſion from the <hi>Vatican</hi> to the <hi>Lateran,</hi> and there gave up the Ghoſt, upon the Spot: and that the Popes have ever ſince gone another way in Proceſſion, for very ſhame of ſuch an Act. And that to avoid the like Error<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:47928:15"/> future, when any Pope is then plac'd in the Porphyry Chair, which hath an hole made for the purpoſe, his Genitals are handled by the youngeſt Deacon. <hi>Goodneſs?</hi> what heap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is here of Lies upon Lies?</p>
                     <p n="4">IV. But here we have a few particulars alſo to take notice of. Firſt, that is it probable or poſſible, can any rational Soul imagine, that this Hermaphrodite ſhould conceive and conceal her great Belly ſo cloſely, that no mortal Creature could in the leaſt perceive it? No, not any one, either of the Church, or Court of <hi>Rome?</hi> Can any ingenious Perſon ever believe that ſuch a wiſe Nation, as the <hi>Romans</hi> are, and always have been, could be ſo groſly impos'd upon; or that they ſhould be ſo Sottiſh or Stupid, as not one of them to know a Woman from a Man; neither by her Voice, Countenance, nor Geſture? And is it not very unlikely, that ſhe ſhould be got with Child now in her declining Age, at which time the Popes are ordinarily Choſe? And that ſhe ſhould be ignorant of her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo near her Time, as to venture to go in proceſſion ſo far on Foot? All very probable, or rather ridiculous Romances. Then as to her going in Proceſſion from the <hi>Vatican</hi> to the <hi>Lateran;</hi> they have here expreſs'd their <hi>Ignorance,</hi> as well as <hi>Malice,</hi> to ſome purpoſe: as not <hi>knowing</hi> that the Popes, at that time, lived not at the <hi>Vatican:</hi> No, not till Pope <hi>Boniface</hi> the <hi>Ninth</hi>'s days, which was ſeveral hundreds of years after the Death of this Pope <hi>Joan.</hi>
                        <pb n="5" facs="tcp:47928:15"/> Fine Coherence in Chronology, is it not? So that 'tis certainly true that this miſtake in <hi>Time</hi> will ruine all, as a very honourable and moſt worthy Perſon ſaid, not long ſince, to a certain Perſon, in another Caſe. Then as to their telling you, very formally; how that the Popes ever ſince, go another way in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion; I will aſſure you 'tis upon another Account <hi>(viz.)</hi> by reaſon of the narrowneſs of the Ways, and difficulty of paſſage for ſo great a Number of People and Horſes, they ſince go a more open and ſafe way; and yet there have been Popes that have gone that way in Proceſſion, ſince that time.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p>HAving thus diſcovered a number of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt Untruths, Improbabilities, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarities, and Ridiculoſities, in the former part of this Story; let us ſee if they can acquit themſelves any better in the latter.</p>
                     <p n="1">I. Firſt, then as to the place theſe Hiſtorians allot her among the Popes, I find as grand a diſagreement therein as in any other Paſſages before; for ſome modern Authors place her between Pope <hi>Leo</hi> the IV. and <hi>Benedict</hi> the III. whereas <hi>Anaſtaſius Bibliothecarius</hi> and <hi>Ado</hi> of <hi>Vienna,</hi> occular Teſtimonies, ſay expreſly, that after <hi>Leo</hi> the IV. there was but only fifteen
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:47928:16"/> days of vacancy, and <hi>Benedict</hi> the III. was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately choſe Pope; to which all of that Age agree that wrote the Pontifical Hiſtory, <hi>(viz.) Regino, Hermanus contractus, Lambertus, Otho Friſingus,</hi> Abbot of <hi>Verſperg, Joannes de Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mana,</hi> and others. But her Hiſtorians and Advocates ſay, ſome of them, that ſhe held the Chair a Year and eight Months, others but four Months, others a Year and an half; and others two Years, one Month, and four Days. Fine Concordance again, is it not? Then ſome will have her ſucceed <hi>Leo</hi> the V. others <hi>Martin</hi> the I. and ſome <hi>Nicholas</hi> the I. ſome call her <hi>John</hi> the VII. others <hi>Jobn</hi> VIII. But 'tis moſt certain, that <hi>John</hi> the VII. was a <hi>Grecian,</hi> and was Pope nineteen Years before this pretended one; and <hi>John</hi> the VIII. was a <hi>Roman,</hi> and preſided twenty Years after, and held the Seat ten Years: ſo conſequently theſe two <hi>Johns</hi> were neither <hi>Engliſh-men</hi> not <hi>Germans.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">II. Then here occurs a very remarkable thing to be ſeriouſly conſidered, wherein may farther appear the improbability of this Story, <hi>(viz.)</hi> that about a hundred Years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the pretended <hi>Being</hi> of this Pope <hi>Joan,</hi> Pope <hi>Leo</hi> the IX. writing to <hi>Michael,</hi> then Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> about the Precedency of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> to abate his Pride, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches him, which a Woman and an Eunuch's, he means <hi>Nicbolas</hi> and <hi>Ignatius,</hi> holding the Patriarchal Seat of <hi>Conſtantinople;</hi> the which certainly he durſt not have done,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:47928:17"/> if the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> had been tainted with the ſame Ignominy; and, without all doubt, the <hi>Grecians</hi> would have been very glad to have had ſuch an opportunity, wherewith to have cenſur'd the Weſtern Churches, if there had been the leaſt appearance of Truth in the Story.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. And here we may eaſily perceive ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther very evident ſign of the falſity of this Story, <hi>viz.</hi> in that all the Authors that lived in this Pope <hi>Joan</hi>'s time, and for 400 years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, make not the leaſt mention of any ſuch Perſon: for the firſt that publiſhed this Fable was one <hi>Martinus Polanus,</hi> who wrote in the year 1320; and this Pope <hi>Joan</hi> lived in the year 870. And indeed, neither did they, nor moſt of thoſe that wrote after them, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late it as for a certain truth; but ſpeak of it rather as a Fable: all of them reporting it with uncertainty, and as a mere common Bruit.</p>
                     <p n="4">IV. Then as to what gave the occaſion of the invention of this Story. I would have the Reader to conſider, that any one that ſhall impartially and judiciouſly read the Lives of the Popes, even from St. <hi>Peter,</hi> ſhall certainly find, that there were three ſorts of them in general. One ſort of them were certainly very eminent for their Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and integrity of living; but had not that ſingular Art or Prudence of Managing or Adminiſtring the Affairs of this World; that is, they were not ſo well acquainted with
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:47928:17" rendition="simple:additions"/> the Temporal Concerns of the World. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother ſort of them there were, who, tho' they were their Crafts-maſters in theſe Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dane Affairs, and knew excellent well the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner and method of ruling theſe Temporal things, with all Prudence and Juſtice; yet theſe were not endued with ſo ſingular a Sanctity of Life, as they ſhould be, but, on the contrary, were rather addicted to their diſordinate and irregular Affections; and Pleaſures, and had but little Zeal, for the things of the Spirit. But then there have been certainly a third ſort, that took ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing af the beſt from both; and ſo Govern'd both with Prudence and Holineſs. Of this worſt and middle ſort then was Pope <hi>John</hi> the Twelfth, who leading indeed a kind of Debauch'd Life, and permitting himſelf to be Govern'd by a Debauch'd Woman, whoſe Name was <hi>JOAN,</hi> gave the People, at that Time, occaſion to ſay, <hi>That it was not the</hi> Pope, <hi>but the</hi> Papiſs, <hi>that Govern'd all things.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="5">V. Laſtly, to let you ſee the folly of this Fable; I ſhall ſhew you what Credit it hath with the moſt learned of the Church of <hi>Rome's</hi> Adverſaries, and plainly prove that 'tis worſe than an old Wives Tale, by their taking this Story for a meer Fable. Firſt, then Mr. <hi>Blondel,</hi> a <hi>French</hi> Miniſter; and one of that account and eſteem in <hi>Paris;</hi> that he was choſen above all, to Anſwer Cardinal <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron</hi>'s learned Book; this Mr. <hi>Blondel,</hi> I ſay,
<pb facs="tcp:47928:18"/> hath written a Book, in <hi>French,</hi> whis was Printed at <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> 1647. on purpoſe to ſhew, that this Story of a She Pope, call'd <hi>Joan,</hi> was a mere Fable. And that we may not think that <hi>Blondel</hi> alone, of all Proteſtant Miniſters held this for a Fable, <hi>Monſieur Sera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius,</hi> a great Calviniſt, and Councellor of the Parliament of <hi>Paris,</hi> in a Letter of his to <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſius,</hi> having mention'd to him this Book of <hi>Blondel</hi>'s, adds theſe words: <hi>Noli autem credere,</hi> &amp;c. don't believe, ſays he, that <hi>Blon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del</hi> was either the firſt, or only Man of our Perſuaſion that was of this Opinion; altho' perhaps no Man hath handled this Matter with more forceable Arguments: for there have been famous Divines of the Reformed Religion, of the ſame Opinion; and there are yet living in this City, Men famous for Fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and Piety, who heard this Hiſtory, vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garly credited, accounted fabulous from <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merius</hi>'s own mouth. I my ſelf lately ſaw Letters of yours and my very good Friend, the Learned <hi>Peter du Moulin,</hi> wherein he affirm'd, that he always believ'd the ſame. I have Letters by me alſo of <hi>Bochart</hi>'s, wherein he averrs that whatſoever was hitherto Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh'd in favour of this Affair, to the World, was meerly Vain and Fictitious. This <hi>Mounſieur Seravius</hi> wrote in a private Letter (tho' his Son, after his Death publiſh'd and printed it) to a Friend of the ſame perſuaſion. And thus you may plainly ſee how this Fable,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:47928:18"/> tho highly maintain'd by the Adverſaries of the Catholick Church thus Expir'd at laſt, as all Lies do, and was carryed to its Grave upon the Shoulders of Four the moſt Famous <hi>French</hi> Miniſters, <hi>(viz.)

But ſuffering afterwards one of her Domeſticks to lye with her, ſhe hid her big Belly a while, till as ſhe was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the <hi>Lateran</hi> Church between the <hi>Coloſſean</hi> Street (ſo called from <hi>Nero's Coloſs,)</hi> and St. <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> her Travail came upon her, and ſhe died upon the place; having ſat two Years, one Month, and four Days, and was buried there without any Pomp. Some ſay the Pope, for ſhame of the thing, doth purpoſely decline going through that Street, when he goes to the <hi>Lateran;</hi> and that to avoid the like
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:47928:20"/> Error, when any Pope is firſt placed in the Porphyry-Chair, which hath an hole made for the purpoſe, his Genitals are bandled by the youngeſt Deacon. As for the Firſt, I deny it not; but for the Second, I take the Reaſon to be, that he who is placed in ſo great Authority, may be minded that he is not a God, but a Man, and obnoxious to the Neceſſities of Nature, as of eaſing his Body; whence that Seat hath the Name of <hi>Sedes Stercoraria:</hi> This Story is vulgarly told, but by very uncertain and obſcure Authors: and therefore I have related it barely, and in ſhort, leſt I ſhould ſeem obſtinate and pertinacious, if I had omitted what is ſo generally talked of.

Then in the next place they'll tell you, that the Popes do not only allow theſe Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to live ſuch a manner of debauched Life, but he alſo takes money to help enrich his Coffers thereby, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But the plain truth of this is, that this money is taken up upon Credit by theſe Romancers, and not by the Pope. For moſt certain it is, that he is ſo far from receiving any money of theſe Drabs, that he is at great Coſt, Charge and Trouble, to hinder their Trading. For ſome of theſe good Old Gentlemen, the Popes of <hi>Rome,</hi> to hinder all young Girls from being naught in turning Whores, have founded Hoſpitals, on purpoſe, where they are carefully brought up, till they be either married, or made Nuns: Nay, and not only ſo, but they give them Dowries alſo to chooſe which they pleaſe, whether they will be married, or made Nuns. And to that purpoſe do they diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute yearly, upon our Lady-day, in Lent, in the <hi>Dominicans</hi> Church, a purſe of money to each young Girl, to the number of three hundred; who are preſented to the Pope then in Being, by the Overſeers of the ſaid Hoſpital. Neither is this all, for theſe Old Gentlemen the Popes, cauſe young Girls of tender years to be taken away from their ſuſpected Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, that are poor, to prevent, leſt their being ſo ſhould cauſe them to ſacrifice their Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginity to Rich Mens Luſt. And moreover, theſe Popes have cauſed a Monaſtery to be
<pb facs="tcp:47928:27"/> built in <hi>Rome</hi> to receive thoſe unfortunate Women in, who would leave that infamous courſe of life, if they had but means to live on without it. Nay they do grant Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences to any that will marry any of theſe Women to free them from their lewd ways, and make them mend. All this they do, and much more: which certainly would be a deſtroying of their own Trade and Gain, if it were true, That they allow of and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the Whores for their proper Gain. For Millers ſurely do not uſe to turn aſide the current of waters from their own Mill.</p>
                     <p n="3">
                        <hi>III.</hi> Then as to the Popes countenancing the Whores of <hi>Rome,</hi> that alſo I will aſſure you they do the clean contrary way. For if that be a countenancing them to forbid them to be at publick meetings, and to appear at Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies where Women of Honour meet; as at the <hi>Corſo</hi> in the Evenings; or at publick Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages, or at the ſung <hi>Opera's</hi> and the like; then they countenance them. If it be a countenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing them to forbid them to go in Coaches in the day time, and to ſtir out of doors in the night time, then they are countenanced by the Popes. If to forbid them to live together, where they might encourage one another, and paſs their time more cheerfully; be a countenancing of them, then you may ſay the Pope countenances the Whores of <hi>Rome.</hi> For theſe Souls live alone, for the moſt part, condemn'd to the melancholic horror of their Crimes, and the ſolitude of ſeven whole

If likewiſe it be a countenancing of Whores, to oblige them to enter their Names publickly in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſter of Whores; then are they countenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by the Popes of <hi>Rome.</hi> But the great Stateſman and Hiſtorian, <hi>Tacitus, Annal.</hi> 2. thought it was a ſufficient puniſhment for un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſte Women, their only profeſſing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be ſuch, before the <hi>Eddes:</hi> and if that Great Man thought ſo, one cannot ſurely but imagine it to be a great puniſhment to Chriſtian Whores (who are, at leaſt, as ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible as the Heathens, of the horrible diſgrace of having their Names liſted) to be thus defam'd for ever, by remaining Whores up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Record.

                     <p n="2">II. But here methinks I hear ſome Puritan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical Politic ſaying: Oh but the Pope being both an Eccleſiaſtical and Temporal Prince and Governor, he is bound to break through all oppoſitions, and to ſettle Innocency and Purity in the World. Now this is Zealouſly ſpoken indeed, and it would be certainly wiſhed by all good Catholics that it could be effected: But what ſays that very wiſe Man and great Maſter of Morals, <hi>Seneca?

<pb n="22" facs="tcp:47928:29"/> known: as alſo ſome years ago in <hi>Walſtein</hi>'s Caſe, his puniſhment had almoſt undone the Emperor. Why may not then the Pope, I pray, without approving the Sins of the Whores, prudently wave the puniſhing them with all rigor, when he ſees that ſuch proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings would certainly cauſe greater diſorders in that hot Country, and in that City where all Nations ſeem to club Vices, as well as Virtues, Hence the Learned <hi>Abulenſis</hi> a great Divine ſaith, <hi>Licet leges humanae, aliquae mala permittant non puniendo; nullum tamen malum permittunt ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuendo.</hi> That is, Altho' human Laws permit ſome Evils by not puniſhing them, yet they permit no Evil by allowing or eſtabliſhing it.</p>
                     <p>Then if any ſhall be ſo ſilly as to ſay that the Pope ſhould not Govern according to human Policy, or human Laws or Examples: I ſhall tell them they pretend a great deal of Zeal indeed; but not according to Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, for if they did, they would take her Siſter Prudence along with them, as our Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Saviour did, who when he heard his Diſciples deſiring him to let them call down Fire from Heaven upon the Criminal <hi>Samari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans,</hi> anſwer'd them very calmly, <hi>You know not of what Spirit you are?</hi> Luke ix. Nay, I pray doth not God himſelf, who being able to puniſh all Criminal Perſons, and to root them quite out of the World, ſuffer both his Sun to ſhine upon Sinners, and Sinners to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend in his Sun-ſhine, and often by it? Hence that Great Dr. of the Church, S. <hi>Thomas Aquinas</hi>
                        <pb facs="tcp:47928:29"/> ſays much to the ſame purpoſe, 2. 2. <hi>q.</hi> 10. <hi>art.</hi> 11. <hi>Humanum regimen,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Human Government</hi> (ſays this Angelical Dr. ſo call'd from his great knowledge he had of the Angelical Natures) <hi>is derived from Divine Government, and we ought to imitate it! Now God, although he be Almighty and highly Good, yet he permits Evil to be done in the world, which it were in his power to hinder; but then by taking away them, greater Goods would be taken away, or greater Evils would follow.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">III. And now after all this, to return to our diſcourſe of theſe Whores; There are many of them that do unfeignedly repent of their lewd Lives, and are heartily ſorrowful for their Sins; and for theſe the Popes of <hi>Rome</hi> have founded a Church and Convent on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, where ſuch Souls are receiv'd and kept all their Life-time, at the Convents Coſt and Charge; where they are lock'd up indeed, but 'tis with their own Requeſt and Conſent: whereas in <hi>Amſterdam</hi> 'tis true Whores are there lock'd up alſo, but 'tis by force and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence. Then in <hi>Rome</hi> theſe poor Women do great Acts of Auſterity and Penance, as the bloody Walls of their Cells when they were laid open by Fire, teſtified to the whole City; but at <hi>Amſterdam</hi> they laugh and are merry. Here no man is permitted to ſpeak alone with them, except their Confeſſor and Phyſician; but there many go to prattle and paſs away their time with theſe wanton Girls, whoſe Faces are plainly ſeen bedeckt with black Patches, the others hid with a Vail, and all ſigns of true Repentance, but there none.</p>

                  <p>For I conceive there appeared to the Prodigals eye ſomething in the <hi>Husks</hi> which might ſerve him to ſatisfie his hunger with: For we find the reaſon why he deſired them, was to have filled his belly with them; or it may be the Devil might beget this opinion in him, that it were better for him to let his corruptions come forth, for that was in order to healing, ſaying, it would be in vain for him to go about to adminiſter a heavenly Plaiſter, until all the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

                  <p>
                     <hi>I</hi> Muſt confeſs, ſuch hath been my incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable deteſtable wickedneſs towards you, as hath moſt juſtly kindled an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenchable fire of fury in your breaſt againſt me vile wretch, moſt juſtly cauſing me to feel the truth of that ſaying, <hi>Prov.</hi> 6. 34. <hi>For jealouſie is the rage of a man; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he will not ſpare in the day of ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance:</hi> So I muſt needs ſay, moſt juſt is the Lord, in bringing to open view theſe by my hidden works of darkneſs. Sir, I muſt needs out of the ſhame and bitterneſs of my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy heart confeſs, that that injury done by me to you is of ſo notorious a nature, as it is not in the leaſt repairable by me; nay if I ſhould leave Ages as your ſlave, and all that time do for you the worſt of ſlavery, it would not be of weight ſufficient to counterpoiſe with that unparalel'd injury done by me to you; how much leſs am I (who have not left me (except the meer mercy of ſome Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors) not the worth of a penny, nor wherewithal to get a penny) able in the leaſt in that caſe to treat with you: But being through mercy made to behold the
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:47928:61"/> greatneſs of my iniquity againſt God, and injury done to you, as made aſtoniſhed, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed, and confounded in my ſelf, at the beholding of the riches of the love of God, which <hi>Paul</hi> well ſaid, <hi>paſſeth underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> if it had not, I had ere this been conſumed; and God himſelf gives the alone reaſon, ſaying, <hi>I am God and change not, therefore you ſons of</hi> Jacob <hi>are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed;</hi> and knowing it my duty ſo far as it lies in my power to ſatisfie all wrongs by me done to or committed againſt any, to the utmoſt of my ability, therefore endeavouring (if poſſible) to be at peace with all men; I am imboldened to tender you the largeſt ſatisfaction, that either you or any elſe can out of my labours, above the maintaining of my poor Wife and Family, whom in the firſt place the laws both of God and nature teach me to provide for; And how much more in this caſe I am bound to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to my poor wife, who with you in this caſe (and that in an unſpeakable manner) hath ſo deeply already ſuffered, I leave to you to judge. And Sir, I muſt humbly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire you to be pleaſed to conſider, that your keeping me in Priſon, doth not only make me uncapable of giving you the leaſt ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and if I alone who merited it, did ſuffer, I ſhould be ſo far from having a thought of
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:47928:61"/> reaping any mercy from you, as I ſhould ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther yield up my ſelf a ſacrifice, to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed on the altar, you will, by the fire of your fury moſt juſtly by me kindled: But O! when I behold other ſuffering for my abominations, it enforceth me to cry out, (as ſecretly to God) ſo to you now to look being an inſtrument in his hand ſcourging thoſe for my iniquities who were not ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers in them with me) though not upon me, yet upon them, with an eye of compaſſion; and I beſeech you, leſt the conſideration that you deſtroy the juſt (in this caſe) with the unjuſt, (if you go on) ſtay your hand; O ſpare but them, and command what you will of me to the utmoſt extremity, I ſhall be willing not only to the utmoſt of what at preſent I am able; but for ever think the utmoſt I can do, too little, in recompence of your mercy in this particular towards my poor Wife and Family, much leſs to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie that injury which in vileſt nature I have done you. O Sir, I beſeech you, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider God, who delights in ſhewing mercy; and doth afflict, not that he might utterly deſtroy, but that thereby he might make us the fitter to receive and prize his mercies; and how honourable a thing it is to be an imitator of ſo heavenly a pattern, in at laſt ſaving thoſe by your mercy, who elſe are
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:47928:62"/> likely to be deſtroyed by your fury. So (Sir) only giving you to underſtand, that herein I have written nothing but the plain truth, and ſincere deſire of my heart, humbly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring you ſeriouſly to read it; and upon mature conſideration, as between God and your own ſoul: and if you ſhall pleaſe to ſend me an anſwer, it will oblige him who is,</p>

                  <p>I Know the law of Cuſtom has made it not only an <hi>uſual favour,</hi> but an <hi>expected duty,</hi> to complement at leaſt, if not flatter, ſuch Women as Men write to, eſpecially the Great Ladies, who think none <hi>write well,</hi> that do not <hi>praiſe them much,</hi> and thoſe <hi>write beſt,</hi> who <hi>extol them moſt:</hi> high Praiſes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing like good Poetry, Muſick in words, the ſound of which may be <hi>agreable,</hi> but truly to <hi>deſerve</hi> them, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires ſuch a <hi>Gygantick</hi> ſize of <hi>merit,</hi> as is very unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable to the ſlender-waſted <hi>Vertues</hi> of moſt La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, who are over-eager to <hi>receive</hi> Praiſes, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>careleſs in <hi>meriting</hi> any: and the grand reaſon is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they know they uſually have them without it; and that <hi>Cuſtome</hi> muſt give it, though <hi>Reaſon</hi> cannot. So obliging is the common courteſie of <hi>England</hi> to Ladies, that it allows them to pretend to all <hi>praiſes</hi> as their <hi>due,</hi> though few deſerve any as their <hi>right.</hi> In a word, our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ladies muſt have their <hi>Characters</hi> writ, juſt as the <hi>Dutch</hi> Madams will have their Pictures drawn, that is, very handſom, though they themſelves be never ſo ugly.</p>
                  <p>But, <hi>Madam,</hi> for your part, I know your <hi>perfections</hi> ſo abundantly, and my own <hi>heart</hi> ſo truly, as I muſt beg the Law of <hi>Cuſtome</hi> pardon here; it being beyond my pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to flatter or complement, ſince I can neither over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praiſe your high <hi>merit,</hi> or outſpeak the real love, and true eſteem, I have both for you and them; ſo that knowing all manner of <hi>praiſes</hi> to be juſtly due to your <hi>merits,</hi> I find I cannot here make you a preſent of any, without doing you an injury, by intitling you to thoſe praiſes by <hi>gift,</hi> which all know are your own by <hi>right.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For truly, <hi>Madam,</hi> the whole progreſs of your actions have ſtill been ſo highly <hi>vertuous,</hi> and religiouſly ſtrict, and ever believed and proclaimed ſuch, that though your <hi>Beauty</hi> might make bad Men <hi>wiſh</hi> you ill, yet your <hi>Vertues</hi> hinder the worſt from daring to <hi>think</hi> you ſo:
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:47928:68"/> for if they did, their own hearts muſt at the ſame time condemn their own thoughts, and declare your innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; like <hi>Pilate,</hi> who with the ſame breath he condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned our Saviour, ſaid, <hi>he found no fault in him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But, <hi>Madam,</hi> tho your vertuous life is ſo tranſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly excellent, yet for all that, you ought to look on your unſoil'd Reputation as no ſmall bleſſing of preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation in theſe ſcandalous times, where ſo few handſom Ladies eſcape cenſure, and ſo many deſerve it: for now the extravagancies of <hi>Romance-Amours</hi> are not only daily <hi>read,</hi> but almoſt hourly <hi>practiſed;</hi> and <hi>Women act</hi> more than <hi>Romances can write;</hi> whilſt the ſober Rules of <hi>Vertue,</hi> and pious Duties of <hi>Religion,</hi> are ſeldom thought on, and moſt ralely practiſed; our Youth being gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally grown ſuch fond friends of Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> his Books, as they are become meer <hi>ſtrangers</hi> to our <hi>Saviour</hi>'s <hi>Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel;</hi> they living as if they were <hi>all bodies,</hi> and had <hi>no ſouls,</hi> or had them but to <hi>loſe,</hi> turning <hi>Religion</hi> into <hi>Rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery,</hi> and <hi>Goſpel</hi> into <hi>Romances:</hi> for thus in ſhort they mangle <hi>Scripture,</hi> that part which is chiefly <hi>Historical,</hi> that is their meer <hi>Goſpel-</hi>part; and that which is the <hi>Goſpel-</hi>part, is their meer <hi>Hiſtorical-</hi>part; and becauſe they cannot <hi>bring the Goſpel</hi> to prove their <hi>Atheiſtical reaſons,</hi> pretend to prove by <hi>Reaſon,</hi> that there is <hi>no Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel:</hi> and if ſome of them now and then look over a Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, they only <hi>paſs through</hi> it, as a Spie doth an <hi>Enemies Country,</hi> with a <hi>miſchievous deſign;</hi> and if they can but find in Scripture a <hi>ſeeming Contradiction,</hi> that they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently bring on the Stage, as they do <hi>Fools</hi> in <hi>Plays,</hi> to <hi>railly</hi> with, and make <hi>ſport</hi> at: ſo great a <hi>Jeſt</hi> our <hi>Young Sparks</hi> now make of their <hi>Salvation,</hi> as to be <hi>pleas'd</hi> in the meer <hi>diſpleaſing God;</hi> without conſidering, 'tis not onely <hi>Atheiſtical madneſs,</hi> but <hi>Devilliſh folly,</hi> to make that their <hi>Jeſt,</hi> which they may be <hi>damn'd for in earneſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus our Youth throw away their <hi>Souls;</hi> and for their <hi>Time,</hi> they care not how they ſpend it, <hi>(always provided it be not religiouſly)</hi> and therefore they waſt it moſt in the company of <hi>vain Women;</hi> and are ſo eager and zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous in their <hi>purſuit,</hi> and ſo conſtant in their <hi>ſervice,</hi> as if they fancied God was <hi>miſtaken,</hi> and intended creating
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:47928:68"/>

                  <p>Nay, when once the Papiſt can but touch the ſmall Needle of any ones reaſon with the great Loadſtone of the Harmonious Doctrine of <hi>a neceſſary Obedience</hi> to their infallible Church, then they make ſuch follow it, to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry point of the Compaſs, be it good, bad, or indifferent; and ſo they fail all their life, in a Trade-wind of <hi>ignorance and ſuperſtition,</hi> and muſt believe their Prieſts words before their own ſenſes, in the plaineſt objects of them; as in the Miracle of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> where you muſt have eyes and ſee not, and hands and feel not, but muſt
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:47928:72"/> believe in a moment <hi>real Bread and Wine</hi> to be turned into <hi>perfect Fleſh and Blood,</hi> though you cannot ſee the leaſt <hi>change</hi> whatſoever: yet they are bound to believe their <hi>Prieſt,</hi> before their <hi>eyes, ſmell, taſt;</hi> nor dare their Prieſt ſay, that the <hi>Conſecrated Bread</hi> (which they eſteem the real Body of Chriſt) will be leſs <hi>mouldy,</hi> or more uncertain of <hi>corruption</hi> after <hi>Conſecration</hi> than before; and the jeſt of it is, that at the ſame time the Papiſts believe that Miracle, they alſo believe this Scripture, <hi>That God will not ſuffer his Holy One to ſee corruption.</hi> And tho for theſe and many other reaſons, I cannot believe this <hi>Tranſubſtantiation-Miracle;</hi> yet I cannot but ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire this <hi>Miracle</hi> that belongs to <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> which is, how the Pope can bring ſo many, that have ſenſe and reaſon to believe it.</p>
                  <p>But I ſhall paſs by their <hi>adoring</hi> this <hi>Sacrament,</hi> their <hi>praying</hi> to <hi>Saints,</hi> and a multitude of their <hi>ſuperſtitious obſervances</hi> never uſed in the <hi>Primative Church;</hi> &amp; ſhall only deſire you, <hi>Madam,</hi> to obſerve in general, that the <hi>Papiſts</hi> follow the Goſpel, juſt as they read <hi>Hebrew,</hi> that's backward; for God plainly commands, that <hi>all ſhould ſearch the Scripture.</hi> And our Bleſſed Saviour ordered the <hi>Sacrament</hi> to be adminiſtred in <hi>both kinds,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 28. And St. <hi>Paul</hi> forbids publick Prayers in an <hi>unknown Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,</hi> but that which is moſt for <hi>Edification,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 15, 16. But theſe plain poſitive commands do not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> from declaring, <hi>that unlearned men ſhall not read and ſearch the Scriptures;</hi> but if we believe St. <hi>Paul</hi> before the <hi>Pope,</hi> we may read in the 17th of the <hi>Acts,</hi> 11. how he commended the noble <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reans</hi> for ſearching the Scriptures; and therefore if <hi>ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the Scriptures</hi> had not been not only lawful, but a commendable act, certainly St. <hi>Paul</hi> would never have commended them for ſo doing. So that the <hi>Popiſh Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy</hi> forbids the reading the Scriptures, under pretence that their Laity might not truly underſtand them. Next, the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> allows only their Clergy (except free Princes, for they are excepters of Perſons, though God is not) to receive the Communion but in <hi>one kind,</hi> tho our Saviour commands, <hi>that all drink of the Cup;</hi> and

                  <p>Therefore if you but pleaſe to read the words of our Saviour carefully, you ſhall find they are moſt plain: for Verſe 13th. <hi>When Jeſus came into the Coaſt of</hi> Caeſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rea, <hi>He ask'd his Diſciples, Whom do men ſay that I am? and they ſaid, Some ſay that thou art</hi> John <hi>the Baptiſt, ſome</hi> Elias, <hi>and others</hi> Jeremias, <hi>or one of the Prophets: but whom ſay ye that I am? and</hi> Simon Peter <hi>anſwered and ſaid, Thou art Chriſt-the Son of the Living God: And I ſay alſo unto thee, that thou art</hi> Peter, <hi>and upon this Rock,</hi> (not this perſon) <hi>I will build my Church; that is</hi> (up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:47928:74"/> this Rock of Faith) <hi>that I am Chriſt the Son of the Living God, I build my Church, and the Gates of Hell ſhall not prevail againſt it.</hi> Now this muſt <hi>neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily</hi> relate to his <hi>faith,</hi> not his <hi>perſon;</hi> for the <hi>gates of Hell,</hi> that's the <hi>power of evil,</hi> did prevail againſt <hi>Peter</hi>'s perſon, or he had not <hi>deny'd</hi> and <hi>forſworn</hi> his Lord and Maſter again and again; and been afterwards proved <hi>blame-worthy</hi> by St. <hi>Paul</hi> to his <hi>face,</hi> and indeed as <hi>blame-worthy</hi> as any of his <hi>Diſciples.</hi> So that 'tis moſt plain, that <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s words (of making him the <hi>Rock</hi> of the <hi>Chriſtian Church)</hi> related not to his <hi>perſon,</hi> but his <hi>faith</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s being the <hi>Son of the Living God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And for the other part; whereas the Papiſts believe a particular <hi>favour</hi> and <hi>power,</hi> given by our Saviour to St. <hi>Peter;</hi> of the Keys of Heaven; that was given as much to the Eleven Diſciples, as to him, as you may read in the <hi>18th</hi> of St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> and in the <hi>20th</hi> of St. <hi>John</hi>'s Goſpel, Verſ. 23, 24. <hi>As my Father hath ſent me, even ſo ſend I you: and when he had ſaid this, he breathed on them, and ſaith unto them, Receive ye the Holy Ghoſt: whoſeſoever ſins ye remit, they are remitted unto them, and whoſeſoever ſins ye retain, they are retained.</hi> So that you ſee this power is general to the Diſciples, and not in particular to St. <hi>Peter,</hi> more than to <hi>any</hi> of the reſt, as the Papiſts misbelieve.</p>
                  <p>The Papiſts have many ſuch Queſtions, which I am ſure, <hi>Madam,</hi> you have neither the patience to read, nor I the time to write; but thoſe that are moſt <hi>material</hi> of them, <hi>you</hi> will find I have here preſented <hi>you,</hi> truly anſwer'd, by pure <hi>Scripture,</hi> clear <hi>reaſons,</hi> plain <hi>arguments,</hi> and all in few words, fit for the weakeſt memory, or ſmall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt pocket, to carry about them: For true <hi>reaſon</hi> doth not conſiſt in large <hi>Volumes,</hi> long <hi>Gowns,</hi> or gray <hi>Beards;</hi> for many live to One and twenty, without attaining to years of diſcretion; the degrees of Age being not ſtill the meaſures of Wiſdom. For the World will never be without old Fools and young Philoſophers.</p>
                  <p>And truly, <hi>Madam,</hi> for my part, I cannot ſo much as think of the Papiſts Religion without wonder, that ſo many rational men of them ſhould rather faſten their
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:47928:74"/> faith of <hi>ſalvation</hi> on the pretended <hi>infallibility</hi> of their Church (which is deny'd by moſt Chriſtians) than on the <hi>Holy Scripture,</hi> which is granted by all, to be the <hi>will</hi> and <hi>word</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and the <hi>very</hi> Foundation of their Churches Foundation, as containing in it all things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to our ſalvation. And we Proteſtants have at leaſt this ſatisfaction and advantage, that not only the Papiſts, but all ſorts of Chriſtians that are in the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of the whole World, meet and joyn with us in this center of Faith, <hi>That the Scriptures contain all things neceſſary to our ſalvation;</hi> which being a general grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Truth, I confeſs I admire how any Papiſt can make the leaſt ſcruple, which is the ſafeſt Heavenly Guide, the <hi>Pope,</hi> or the <hi>Goſpel.</hi> If there be any rational man ſo <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant</hi> as to put them in the ſame <hi>ballance,</hi> and to commit a <hi>rape</hi> upon his <hi>Reaſon,</hi> I ſhall only deſire him to conſider this plain Queſtion. If he were to go a Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney in an unknown way, would he not think it more rational and ſafe to follow a certain true Guide, that all the Chriſtians in the World declare is certainly able and ready to ſhew him the right way, than to follow a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Guide, which the greateſt part of the Chriſtians in the World aſſures him will lead him out of it. And this being the real difference between the Papiſt and Proteſtant in groſs, concerning the Heavenly Guide, the Bible, and the Pope, I think I need now ſay no more, becauſe ſo many have already ſaid ſo much, and I am ſure enough to ſatisfie any, except ſuch, who will believe a crooked Rule is better to draw a ſtraight line by, than a right one.</p>
                  <p>And now, <hi>Madam,</hi> I ſhall only beg ſo much of your patience, as to let me tell you, that the plot and Heads of this following diſcourſe, I have Extracted out of the worthy <hi>Collingworth.</hi> Before I begin the diſcourſe it ſelf, I know, in writing a Play, to have Rank'd the plot in the Front of it, and to make the whole deſign of the Prologue to be the Key to uncipher the plot of the Play, (though anciently in uſe) had been now, not only out of faſhion, but beſide reaſon: For the deſign of Plays aiming chiefly to pleaſe the ſenſes, they ought
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:47928:75"/> to be compounded and mixt with hopes and fears, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainties and uncertainties, expectations and delays of the event of the plot; which being all ſo interwoven together, creates the agreeableneſs of the Play; for when once the whole plot is diſcovered, the pleaſure of the Play is ended; like Hare-Hunting, the ſport lies not in preſently taking the Hare, but in following him, in all his Rings and Doubles. And thoſe that love Plays, and ſuch Huntings, reſemble jealous men, who eagerly purſue what they apprehend to overtake; or as old Age, which we all pray to attain, but fear to approach.</p>
                  <p>But now I come to ſoar my diſcourſe to a much higher pitch, and a more Elevated Subject, and to treat of the moſt noble part of man, the Soul; and of true Religion the only way to Heavenly felicity: For <hi>without Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, no man ſhall ſee the Lord.</hi> We muſt therefore now, <hi>Madam,</hi> change the Scene of ſenſe for a ſpiritual one, and climb where earthly nature can never follow us, to the pure and high Region of Heaven; which will inform us that the earlier diſcovering our plot of attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Heaven, will but better the play; and the more ſpeed, the better ſucceſs: For the joys of Heaven are everlaſting, and admit of no increaſe or diminution: not like the divertiſements of Stage-plays, or Hunting, or any earthly delights, which cannot laſt but for a ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and decay in our very injoying them, and muſt ſoon leave us, or we them: But Heavenly thoughts, the more and longer we practice them, the better we ſhall like them; Heavenly joys ſo far exceeding all we can here leave, as they are all we can ever aſpire to have: This we all know, but few of us practice; and we all love God, but few love to keep his Commandments.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall therefore now, <hi>Madam,</hi> tell you, as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue to my inſuing diſcourſe, that the grand Plot, and whole deſign of it, moves chiefly on theſe two hinges. Firſt, in confirming you, that the foundation of the Proteſtant Religion is built on <hi>God</hi>'s holy Word, the Scriptures; which we Proteſtants eſteem to be a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Rule of Faith, and guide to our actions, and true Touch-ſtone to try all matters by, that relate to the

                  </p>
                  <p>In following the <hi>Scripture</hi> we have <hi>God's</hi> expreſs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and no colour of any prohibition: but to believe the <hi>Papiſh Church infallible,</hi> we have no <hi>Scripture-command</hi> at all, much leſs an expreſs one.</p>
                  <p>Following the <hi>Popiſh Church,</hi> we muſt believe many <hi>things</hi> not only above <hi>reaſon,</hi> but againſt <hi>reaſon,</hi> witneſs <hi>Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation;</hi> whereas following the <hi>Scripture,</hi> we ſhall believe Many <hi>mysteries,</hi> but no <hi>impoſſibilities;</hi> many things above our <hi>reaſon,</hi> but nothing againſt it. Nay, we need not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve any thing, which <hi>reaſon</hi> will not convince us we ought to believe: for <hi>reaſon</hi> will convince any ſober <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> that

                  </p>
                  <p>In a word, we <hi>Proteſtants</hi> believe that all things neceſſary to our <hi>ſalvation</hi> are evidently contain'd in <hi>Scripture,</hi> &amp; what is not there <hi>evidently</hi> contained, cannot be neceſſary to be <hi>believed;</hi> and our <hi>reaſon</hi> is juſt and clear, Becauſe nothing can challenge our <hi>Belief,</hi> as to <hi>ſalvation,</hi> but what hath deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended to us from our Bleſſed Saviour <hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> by ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal and univerſal <hi>Tradition.</hi> Now nothing but <hi>Scripture</hi> hath thus deſcended to us, therefore nothing but <hi>Scripture</hi> can challenge our <hi>Belief.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now the grand difference between the <hi>Papiſts</hi> and us, concerning the <hi>Scripture,</hi> is this: We hold the <hi>Scripture</hi> to be the only <hi>perfect rule</hi> whereby to judge of <hi>controverſies.</hi> The <hi>Papiſts</hi> ſay, That they acknowledge the <hi>Scuriptures</hi> to be a <hi>perfect rule:</hi> only they deny that it excludes unwritten <hi>Tradition;</hi> which in effect is this: they ſay, <hi>'Tis as perfect a Rule, as a Writing can be,</hi> only they deny it to <hi>be as perfect a Rule as a Writing may be.</hi> Either they muſt revoke their <hi>acknowledgment,</hi> or retract their <hi>contradiction</hi> of it, for both cannot poſſibly ſtand together: For if they will but ſtand to what they have granted, <hi>That</hi> Scripture <hi>is as perfect a Rule of Faith as a Writing can be,</hi> they muſt then grant it ſo <hi>compleat,</hi> as it needs no <hi>addition;</hi> and ſo <hi>evident</hi> that it needs no <hi>interpretation:</hi> for both theſe <hi>properties</hi> are requiſite to a <hi>perfect Rule.</hi> And that a <hi>writing</hi> is capable of both theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties and perfections, is moſt plain: for he that denies it, muſt ſay, <hi>that ſomething may be ſpoken which cannot be writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten;</hi> for if ſuch a compleat <hi>evident rule of Faith</hi> may be delivered by word of mouth, as the <hi>Papiſts</hi> pretend may, &amp; is, <hi>and whatſoever is delivered by word of mouth, may alſo be written;</hi> then ſuch a compleat and evident <hi>rule of Faith,</hi> may alſo be written: For the <hi>Argument</hi> is moſt plain, <hi>Whatſoever may be ſpoken may be written;</hi> a perfect <hi>rule of Faith</hi> has been ſpoken, therefore a perfect <hi>rule of Faith</hi> may be written. If the <hi>Papiſts</hi> cannot ſee this plain Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, they had beſt deſire more light to be added to the <hi>Sun.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Papiſts</hi> pretend their <hi>Church</hi> to be the <hi>infallible teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> of all <hi>Divine Truths,</hi> and an <hi>infallible Interpreter</hi> of all <hi>obſcurities</hi> in the <hi>Faith:</hi> But the <hi>Papiſts</hi> will, I hope give us
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:47928:78"/> leave to admire, how they can pretend to Teach them in all places, without writing them down; that is certainly beyond the reach of their power to do, as well as our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief that 'tis to be done.</p>
                  <p>And for the <hi>Papiſts</hi> ſaying there muſt be a living authority beſide the <hi>Scripture,</hi> or elſe controverſies cannot be ended; <hi>Proteſtants</hi> anſwer: Neceſſary controverſies are and may be decided; and if they be not, 'tis not the defect of the rule in <hi>Scripture,</hi> but the default of men; ſo that if neceſſary contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies be ended, 'tis no matter if the unneceſſary be not: for doubtleſs if <hi>God</hi> had required it, he would alſo have provided ſome means to effect it; but ſure it does not ſtand with any reaſon it ſhould be the <hi>Pope,</hi> becauſe he cannot be a <hi>Judge,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a <hi>party:</hi> indeed in civil controverſies, a Judge without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a party may end them; but in controverſies of Religion, a Judge of neceſſity muſt be a concerned party; and I am ſure the <hi>Pope</hi> to us i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> the chief, and moſt concerned party, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing really concerned as much as his Popedom is worth.</p>
                  <p>Now we <hi>Proteſtants</hi> make the <hi>Papiſts</hi> this plain anſwer, that the means of agreeing differences, muſt neceſſarily be, either by the appointment of God, or men: men ſure it cannot be, for then rational wiſe <hi>Proteſtants</hi> may do as well as <hi>Papiſts;</hi> for let the Papiſts ſhew us if they can, where <hi>God</hi> hath appointed that the Pope alone, or any confirm'd by the Pope, or that Society of Chriſtians which adhere to him, ſhall be the <hi>infallible Judge</hi> of Controverſies: we deſire the Papiſts, if they can, to let us ſee any of thoſe aſſertions plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſet down in <hi>Scripture,</hi> as in all reaſon a thing of this nature ought to be, or at leaſt delivered with a full conſent of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; nay let them ſo much as ſhew us where 'tis in plain terms taught by any one Father in Four hundred years after our bleſſed <hi>Saviour Chriſt:</hi> and if the Papiſts cannot do this, as we believe they cannot; where I pray is their either <hi>Scripture</hi> or <hi>Reaſon,</hi> that the Pope or his Councils ſhould obtrude themſelves as Judges over us Proteſtants.</p>
                  <p>Next, we would deſire to know from the Papiſts, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they do certainly know, or not, the ſenſe of thoſe <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi> by which they are led to the knowledge of their Church; for if they do not, how come they to know their Church is <hi>infallible?</hi> but if they do, then ſure they ought to
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:47928:78"/> give us leave to have the ſame means and ability to know o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther plain places in <hi>Scripture,</hi> which they have to know theirs: for if all <hi>Scriptures</hi> be obſcure, how come they to know the ſenſe of thoſe places? but if ſome place of it be plain, why pray may not Proteſtants underſtand them as well as Papiſts?</p>
                  <p>The Papiſts ſay, That the <hi>Scriptures</hi> are in themſelves true and infallible, yet without the direction of the Church we have no certain means to know which <hi>Tranſlations</hi> be faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and Canonical, or what is the true meaning of <hi>Scriptures:</hi> and this is the common <hi>Argument</hi> and general <hi>Belief</hi> of all Papiſts. To which the Proteſtants anſwer, That yet all theſe things muſt firſt be known, before we can know the directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of their Church to be <hi>infallible:</hi> for the Papiſts cannot pretend any other proof of it, but only ſome Texts of Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical <hi>Scripture,</hi> truly interpreted; therefore either they muſt be miſtaken in thinking there is no other means to know theſe things, but their Churches <hi>infallible</hi> direction; or elſe we muſt be excluded from all means of knowing her dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions to be <hi>infallible:</hi> for the proof muſt be ſurer than the thing to be proved, or 'tis no proof. And upon better con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, I am confident the Papiſts dare not deny, but that 'tis moſt certain, <hi>Faith</hi> hath been given by other means than the Church: for ſure they will not ſay, that <hi>Adam</hi> received Faith by the Church, nor <hi>Abraham,</hi> nor <hi>Job,</hi> who received Faith by Revelation; and alſo the Holy Apoſtles, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Faith by the Miracles and Preaching of our Bleſſed Saviour: So that you ſee, and they cannot deny, but their ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Doctrine is contradictory. And to make it yet plainer, I deſire to know of the Papiſts, if they ſhould meet with a man that believed neither <hi>Scripture, Church,</hi> nor <hi>God,</hi> but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares he is both ready and willing to believe them all, if the Papiſt can ſhew him ſufficient <hi>grounds</hi> to build his <hi>Faith</hi> upon; will the Papiſt tell ſuch a man, there are no certain <hi>grounds</hi> how he may be converted to their Church, or there are? if the Papiſts ſay there are none, they make Religion an uncertain thing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but if they ſay there are, then they muſt neceſſarily either argue woman-like, that their Church is <hi>infallible,</hi> becauſe it is <hi>infallible;</hi> or elſe ſhew there are other certain <hi>grounds</hi> beſides ſaying the Church is <hi>infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> to prove its <hi>Infallibility.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="26" facs="tcp:47928:79"/>
                  <p> The <hi>Papiſts</hi> demand of the <hi>Proteſtants, If they believe the Apoſtles wrote all the Scriptures:</hi> for if they did not, how come we to call and believe them <hi>Apoſtolical,</hi> and not the <hi>Writings</hi> of thoſe that writ them? To which we anſwer; <hi>Though all the Scriptures were not written by the Apoſtles themſelves, yet they were all confirm'd by them; and tho a Clerk writes a Statute, and the King, Lords and Commons confirm it in Parliament; I believe they would eſteem it very impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to call it the Statute of ſuch a Clerk, tho writ by him, but an Act of Parliament, becauſe it was confirm'd by all their cenſents, and becomes their Act, not the Clerks.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Papiſts</hi> deſire us to tell them <hi>in what Language the Scriptures remained incorrupted;</hi> and we deſire them to ſatisfie us <hi>whether it be neceſſary to know it, or not neceſſary:</hi> if it be not, I hope we may do well without it; but if it be neceſſary, we deſire firſt that <hi>they</hi> will pleaſe to tell us what became of their <hi>Church</hi> for One thouſand five hundred Years together, all which time they muſt confeſs, they had no certainty of <hi>Scripture;</hi> till the time that Pope <hi>Clement</hi> the 8th. ſet forth their approved Edition of the vulgar <hi>Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> and none ſure can have the <hi>confidence</hi> to deny, but that there was great <hi>variety</hi> of <hi>Copies</hi> currant in divers parts of their <hi>Church,</hi> and read ſo; which Copies might be falſe in ſome things, but more than one ſort of them could not poſſibly be true in all things. And Pope <hi>Sixtus Quintus</hi> his <hi>Bible</hi> differ'd from Pope <hi>Clement</hi> his <hi>Bible,</hi> in a multitude of places; which makes us de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to be ſatisfied of the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> whether before Pope <hi>Six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus Quintus</hi> his time, their Church had any defined Canon of <hi>Scriptures</hi> or not: for if they had not, then 'tis moſt <hi>evident</hi> that their Church was a moſt <hi>excellent keeper</hi> of <hi>Scripture,</hi> for Fifteen hundred years together, that had not all that time defin'd what was <hi>Scripture,</hi> and what was not; but if the <hi>Papiſts</hi> ſay they had, then we demand, Was that ſet forth by Pope <hi>Sixtus Quintus,</hi> or was it ſet forth by Pope <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?</hi> or if by a third <hi>different</hi> from them both, why do they not name him? if it were that ſet forth by Pope <hi>Sixtus,</hi> then 'tis now condemn'd by Pope <hi>Clement;</hi> if that of <hi>Clement,</hi> 'twas condemned by that of <hi>Sixtus:</hi> So that error muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily be betwixt <hi>them,</hi> let <hi>them</hi> chuſe which <hi>ſide they pleaſe.</hi>

                  <p>We further deſire to be ſatisfied of the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> if the Books of <hi>Eccleſiaſticus,</hi> and <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> and the Epiſtle to St. <hi>James,</hi> were by the holy <hi>Apoſtles</hi> approved Canonical, or not: if they were approved by the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> Canonical, ſure the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts</hi> cannot deny, but they had a ſufficient <hi>difinition</hi> and <hi>authority,</hi> not to queſtion them, and therefore <hi>err'd</hi> in doing ſo. And if they were not approved Canonical by the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,</hi> with what <hi>impudence</hi> dare the <hi>Roman</hi> Church now ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove them as <hi>Canonical,</hi> and yet pretend that all their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine is <hi>Apoſtolical?</hi> And if they ſay theſe Books were not queſtioned, they ſhould do well to tell which Books they mean, which were not always known to be <hi>Canonical,</hi> but have afterwards been receiveed by the <hi>Roman</hi> Church to be ſuch: ſo that this <hi>Argument</hi> reaches thoſe, as well as theſe.</p>
                  <p>And further we are to conſider, that there is not the ſame <hi>reaſons</hi> for the Churches <hi>abſolute Infallibility,</hi> as for the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> and <hi>Scriptures:</hi> for if the Church falls into an error, it may be reformed by comparing it with the Rules of the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> Doctrine in <hi>Scripture;</hi> but if the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> have err'd in delivering the Doctrine of Chriſtianity in <hi>Scripture;</hi> then the <hi>Roman</hi> Church cannot be <hi>infallible:</hi> For <hi>Apoſtles, Prophets,</hi> and <hi>Canonical Writers,</hi> and the foundation of the Church, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays 'tis built upon the foundation of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles</hi> and <hi>Prophets.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And now to conclude this part of my diſcourſe in very few words, let the <hi>Papiſts</hi> anſwer, if they can, but theſe five words. <hi>All Scripture is Divinely inſpired.</hi> Let them ſhew us ſo much for the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, and ſhew us if they can, where 'tis written in <hi>Scripture,</hi> that all the decrees of the <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Church</hi> are Divinely inſpired, and all our <hi>Controverſies</hi> will be at an end: but I believe they can never do that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out another <hi>Tranſubſtantiation-Miracle</hi> of words.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Papiſts</hi> deſire us to ſhew them an exact <hi>Catalogue</hi> of our <hi>fundamentals;</hi> to which we anſwer, That <hi>God</hi> may be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently known to one, and not ſufficiently declared to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and conſequently, that may be fundamental and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:47928:80"/> to one, which is not to another; which variety of <hi>circumſtances</hi> renders it impoſſible to ſet down an exact <hi>Catalogue</hi> of <hi>Fundamentals:</hi> for God requires more of them to whom he gives more, and leſs of thoſe to whom he gives leſs; more of a <hi>commander</hi> of a <hi>Kingdom,</hi> than a poor ſimple <hi>Turnſpit.</hi> 'Tis a plain revelation of <hi>God</hi> to us Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, that the <hi>Sacrament of the Euchariſt</hi> ſhould be admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred in both kinds, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 28. &amp; that the publick <hi>Hymns</hi> and <hi>Prayers</hi> of the Church ſhould be in ſuch a <hi>Language</hi> as is moſt for Edification, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 15, 16. yet the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> not ſeeing this, by reaſon of the <hi>vail,</hi> would be <hi>very angry</hi> if we told <hi>them</hi> 'twould <hi>prejudice</hi> their <hi>ſuppoſed Infallibility.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We read in St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> that the <hi>Goſpel</hi> was to be Preacht <hi>to all Nations;</hi> and this was a <hi>truth</hi> revealed before our <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours</hi> Aſcention: yet if the Church had been asked, before the converſion of <hi>Cornelius,</hi> they would have certainly told you, it had not been neceſſary to <hi>teach all Nations;</hi> for 'tis moſt apparent out of <hi>Acts</hi> 11. they all believed ſo, until St. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> was better informed by a viſion from <hi>Heaven,</hi> and the converſion of <hi>Cornelius;</hi> and then they turn'd quite of a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering belief, and eſteemed it neceſſary to <hi>teach all Nations;</hi> and yet were ſtill a Church. The Papiſts are pleaſed to ſay, the Proteſtants differ in <hi>Fundamentals;</hi> which indeed ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to us very <hi>irrational:</hi> For if they ſay, We Proteſtants differ in <hi>Fundamentals,</hi> how then can they ſay, We are <hi>mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers</hi> of the ſame Church, one with another, more than they are with ours, or ours with theirs? and why do they <hi>object</hi> our <hi>difference</hi> more with one another, than with themſelves? and if we do not differ in <hi>Fundamentals,</hi> why do they up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braid us with <hi>Fundamental differences</hi> amongſt our ſelves? We believe the <hi>Catholick Church</hi> cannot periſh, yet we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve ſhe may and did <hi>err,</hi> as I prov'd juſt before: but thus much we Proteſtants declare in general, That we eſteem it ſufficient for any mans <hi>ſalvation,</hi> to believe <hi>God's</hi> Word, the <hi>Scripture,</hi> and that it contains all <hi>things neceſſary to our ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> and that we do our utmoſt <hi>endeavours</hi> to find, believe, and follow the true ſenſe of it; and being we are ſure that all that is any way neceſſary is there, believing all that is there, we are ſure we believe all that is neceſſary.</p>
                  <p>And therefore 'tis but reaſonable to ſay, that any private
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:47928:80"/> perſon, who truly believes the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> and heartily endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to know the Will of <hi>God,</hi> and to do it, is as ſecure, nay <hi>ſecurer</hi> from the danger of <hi>erring in Fundamentals,</hi> than the <hi>Roman</hi> Church: for 'tis impoſſible any man ſo <hi>qualified</hi> ſhould fall into an <hi>error</hi> that can prove <hi>damnable</hi> to him; for <hi>God</hi> requires no more of any man to his <hi>ſalvation,</hi> but only his true and beſt endeavours to be <hi>ſaved.</hi> And for the Papiſts <hi>Sacrament of Confeſſion,</hi> which they hold is ſo <hi>abſolute</hi> and <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſary,</hi> and ſo much upbraid us for the want of it; we an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer: We know no ſuch <hi>abſolute neceſſity of it;</hi> but yet we hold, we muſt not only <hi>confeſs our ſins, but forſake them,</hi> or we ſhall not find <hi>mercy:</hi> And we Proteſtants farther believe, that they that <hi>confeſs their ſins, ſhall find mercy,</hi> though they only confeſs them to <hi>God,</hi> and not to Man: And more, that they who confeſs them both to <hi>God</hi> and Man, and do not in time forſake them, ſhall not find <hi>mercy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And ſo for the Papiſts <hi>Sacrament of Repentance for Remiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſins;</hi> tho we Proteſtants know no ſuch, yet we allow &amp; obſerve the ſame Duty, but <hi>publick</hi> before the Church; which was the <hi>conſtant practice</hi> of the primitive Church; and <hi>Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanus</hi> himſelf, though ſo great a Champion for the Papiſts, writes, That the <hi>confeſſion</hi> then uſed, was before the Church; and that <hi>Auricular confeſſion</hi> was not then in the World.</p>
                  <p>The Papiſts will tell you that our <hi>Biſhops</hi> have not the true power of <hi>Ordination:</hi> but <hi>that has</hi> been ſo <hi>clearly anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> and ſo <hi>truly proved at large</hi> by ſo many already, as I ſhall not need here ſo much as to name it: only let me in a word <hi>remember</hi> the Papiſts, that they cannot well deny, but that the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> themſelves, whom the Papiſts eſteemed as bad as us, as being <hi>Hereticks</hi> and <hi>Schiſmaticks;</hi> yet St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> and <hi>Optatus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> did both acknowledge that they had the ſame <hi>Baptiſm, Creed,</hi> and <hi>Sacrament;</hi> and that theſe <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natiſt</hi> Fathers, tho <hi>Schiſmaticks</hi> and <hi>Hereticks,</hi> gave true Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination, or elſe ſome of theſe were not then eſteemed <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments;</hi> therefore let them take which they pleaſe, there muſt be error of one ſide.</p>
                  <p>The Papiſts pretend they have an unanſwerable <hi>Objection</hi> againſt Proteſtants, which is, <hi>That we have diſcords in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Faith, without any means of agreement:</hi> To which we anſwer, <hi>That the Scripture does not let us want ſolid means of</hi>
                     <pb n="30" facs="tcp:47928:81"/> 
                     <hi>agreement in matters neſſary to ſalvation;</hi> and for our agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in all controverſies of <hi>Religion,</hi> either they muſt ſay we have means to agree about them, or we have not: if they ſay we have, why did they before deny it? if they ſay we have no <hi>means,</hi> why are they ſo unjuſt to find <hi>fault</hi> with us for not <hi>agreeing,</hi> when <hi>they themſelves</hi> ſay we have no <hi>means</hi> to <hi>agree?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But for a Plaiſter to this Saor, they are ſo extraordinary civil, as to tell us, <hi>we may come to their Church;</hi> and they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree in <hi>matters of faith:</hi> But the plain truth of it is, that they define all <hi>matters of faith</hi> to be thoſe wherein they agree; ſo that to ſay the <hi>Roman</hi> Church does agree in <hi>matters of faith,</hi> is but to ſay, they do agree in thoſe things they do agree in: and ſure they cannot deny, but we <hi>Proteſtants</hi> do the ſame.</p>
                  <p>But we muſt deſire the <hi>Papiſts</hi> to give us leave to tell them, that they moſt groſly miſtake, if they ſay, they agree in <hi>matters of Faith:</hi> as for proof; ſome of them hold it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Faith, to take the <hi>Oath of Allegiance,</hi> others 'tis againſt Faith to refuſe that Oath.</p>
                  <p>Some hold it of <hi>Faith,</hi> that the <hi>Pope</hi> is Head of the <hi>Church</hi> by <hi>Divine Law;</hi> others the contrary: ſome hold it of Faith that the <hi>bleſſed Virgin</hi> was free from <hi>actual ſin,</hi> others the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary; ſome that the <hi>Popes</hi> power over Princes in Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralities is <hi>de fide,</hi> others the contrary: ſome that 'tis univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal <hi>Tradition</hi> that the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> was conceived in <hi>actual ſin,</hi> others the contrary. And how the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> and <hi>Franciſcans,</hi> and other Orders differ to this day, I am ſure needs no <hi>memorandum;</hi> and the beſt Jeſt of all is, the <hi>Papiſts</hi> have not ſo much as yet agreed in their very pretended means of <hi>agreement,</hi> and yet have the <hi>confidency</hi> to pretended an <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi> more than the <hi>Proteſtants;</hi> for ſome of them ſay, The <hi>Pope</hi> with a <hi>Council</hi> may determine all <hi>Controverſies,</hi> others deny it: Some hold, That a general <hi>Council,</hi> without a <hi>Pope,</hi> may do ſo; others deny this: Others ſay, Both in conjunction are <hi>infallible Determiners,</hi> others deny this: And ſome a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Papiſts</hi> hold, The acceptation of the Decrees of <hi>Councils</hi> by the Univerſal Church, is the only way to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide <hi>Controverſies;</hi> which others deny, by denying their Church to be <hi>infallible;</hi> and yet every part pretends to be part of the Church.</p>
                  <p>In a word, can the <hi>Papiſh</hi> deny, but that there has been
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:47928:81"/> Popes againſt Popes, Councils againſt Councils; Nay, Councils confirmed by Popes, againſt Popes confirmed by Councils: And laſtly, the Church of ſome Ages, againſt the Church of other Ages? And ſince every part of the Body is ſo out of order, methinks they ſhould not brag of ſo perfect a health as they do.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Papiſts</hi> ſay (and do but ſay it) that their <hi>Doctrine</hi> is held <hi>Catholick;</hi> and therefore they eſteem it an <hi>inſolent mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> of us <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> to diſpute againſt the <hi>practice</hi> of the whole Church. Firſt, <hi>That their Doctrine is Catholick;</hi> we anſwer, <hi>That the greateſt number of Chriſtians in the world deny it;</hi> ſo that they cannot truly ſay, we diſpute againſt the <hi>practice</hi> of the whole Church. And farther we ſay, <hi>Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing we ſhould in Complement to them grant, that their Church is Catholick and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal;</hi> yet we ſay, That is no ſufficient proof it came Originally from the <hi>Apoſtles;</hi> wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs the Doctrine of the <hi>Millenaries,</hi> and the neceſſity of the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> for <hi>Infants;</hi> which was generally taught by the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Church,</hi> &amp; believed as an <hi>Apoſtolical Tradition,</hi> but yet contradicted by the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Church</hi> afterwards: This, I am ſure, the <hi>Papiſts</hi> dare not deny; ſo that we una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidably caſt the <hi>Papiſts</hi> upon this <hi>Rock, That they muſt either conclude the</hi> Apoſtles <hi>were Fountains of contradictory Doctrines, or that the</hi> Univerſal Doctrine <hi>of the preſent Church is no ſufficient proof that it came originally from the</hi> Apoſtles, <hi>becauſe the Church <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal of one time, and the Church <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal of another time did differ.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Next, for their ſaying, <hi>'tis inſolent madneſs to diſpute a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the practice of the whole Church;</hi> Firſt, we are ſure, we can bring more Chriſtian witneſſes that deny they are the <hi>whole Church,</hi> than they can bring to prove it: but ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing we were as mad as they ſay we are, and would have us to be, <hi>to diſpute againſt the whole practice of the Church;</hi> yet I hope we may deſire to know of the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> if they can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny but that 'twas the practice of the <hi>whole Church</hi> in St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin</hi>'s time, and eſteemed then an <hi>Apoſtolical Tradition</hi> even by St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> himſelf, that the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> ſhould be admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred to <hi>Infants?</hi> And then let them tell us, Whether it be <hi>inſolent madneſs to diſpute againſt the practice of the whole Church,</hi> or is it not? If it be not, why do they accuſe us for it? But if it be <hi>inſolent madneſs,</hi> how mad
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:47928:82"/> and <hi>inſolent</hi> is the Papiſts Church, not only to <hi>diſpute</hi> againſt this <hi>practice</hi> of the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Church,</hi> of adminiſtring the <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt</hi> to <hi>Infants,</hi> but utterly aboliſhing the practice of it?</p>
                  <p>So that the very worſt the Papiſts can ſay of us, allowing what they ſay to be true, is, <hi>that we but do, what they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves own already to have done.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And tho the Papiſts are pleaſed to ſay that the Holy <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi> and ancient <hi>Fathers,</hi> aſſign <hi>ſeparation</hi> from the viſible Church as a mark of <hi>Hereſie,</hi> yet they cannot ſhew one plain Text of <hi>Scripture</hi> to confirm it.</p>
                  <p>And for the Papiſts bragging of the <hi>Antiquity</hi> and <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſality</hi> of their Churches <hi>Doctrine,</hi> (tho we allow it very <hi>ancient,</hi> bating the <hi>primitive times)</hi> we anſwer firſt as to its <hi>Antiquity,</hi> we deſire to ſee what <hi>Antiquity</hi> they can ſhew for their giving the Communion but in one kind, when they know that the <hi>adminiſtring</hi> it in both kinds, was the <hi>practice</hi> of the Church for a Thouſand years after <hi>Chriſt;</hi> what An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity for the lawfulneſs and expediency of the <hi>Latine Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice;</hi> for the preſent uſe of <hi>Indulgences;</hi> for the Popes power in <hi>Temporalities over Princes;</hi> for the Picturing the <hi>Trinity;</hi> for the lawfulneſs of worſhipping <hi>Pictures and Images;</hi> for their <hi>Beads;</hi> for their whole worſhip of the <hi>bleſſed Virgin;</hi> for their <hi>Oblations,</hi> in the notion of <hi>Sacrifices</hi> to her and other <hi>Saints;</hi> for their ſaying <hi>Pater Nosters</hi> and <hi>Creeds</hi> to the Honour of them, and <hi>Ave Maries</hi> to the Virgin <hi>Mary;</hi> for the <hi>infallibility</hi> of the Biſhop or Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> for their <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the bleſſed Virgins Immunity from actual ſin; for the neceſſity of <hi>Auricular confeſſion;</hi> for the neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Prieſts <hi>intention</hi> to obtain <hi>benefit</hi> by any of their <hi>Sacraments;</hi> and laſtly, for their licentious Doctrine, in hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>that tho a man lives and dies without the practice of any Chriſtian Vertue, and with the Habits of many damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſins unmortified; yet if at the laſt moment of his life he has any ſorrow for his ſins, and joyn confeſſion to it, he ſhall cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly be ſaved:</hi> This is a Doctrine may keep many Souls out of Heaven, but I doubt will ſcarce carry any one there. So that the Papiſts Doctrine being ancient, is nothing, as long as 'tis <hi>evident</hi> that they hold many <hi>dangerous errors:</hi> As for inſtance, the <hi>Millenaries,</hi> and the <hi>Communicating Infants</hi> was more <hi>ancient</hi> than their Doctrine; and 'tis plain that An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:47928:82"/> unleſs it be <hi>abſolute</hi> and <hi>primative,</hi> is not a certain ſign of true Doctrine, and the very Apoſtles themſelves, aſſure us, that in their days the myſtery of Iniquity was working.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Papiſts</hi> demand how comes it to paſs that their Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine is ſo Univerſal, (forgetting that weeds ſpread faſter than good herbs:) And we ask them how the <hi>errours</hi> of the <hi>Millenaries,</hi> and the <hi>Communicating Infants</hi> became ſo univerſal? let them tell us this, and we will tell them that: for what is done in ſome, may be done in others.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Papiſts</hi> ask us where our Ch. was before <hi>Luther;</hi> and tell us, becauſe 'twas no Ch. before him, therefore it can be no true Church at all. To which we anſwer, That this cauſe is no cauſe: for tho <hi>Luther</hi> had no being before <hi>Luther,</hi> yet none can deny, but that he was when he was, tho he could not be before he was. So there may be a true Church after <hi>Luther,</hi> tho there was none for ſome Ages before him: as ſince <hi>Columbus</hi> his time there have been Chriſtians in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica,</hi> tho there were none for many Ages before. For it does not follow, that nothing but a Church can poſſibly get a Church, nor that the preſent being of a true Church depends neceſſarily upon the perpetuity of a Church in all Ages. For though I cannot deny the Churches perpetui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, yet that's not here neceſſary to rur difference: but that a falſe Church (by Gods providence over-ruling it) may preſerve a means of confuting their own Hereſies, and ſo reduce men to Truth, and raiſe a true Church, (I mean the integrity of the Word of God with Men.) Thus the <hi>Jews</hi> preſerve means to make men <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts</hi> preſerve means to make men <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> and the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants</hi> falſe Church (as the <hi>Romans</hi> call it) preſerves men <hi>Papiſts.</hi> Nor does it appear that the perpetuity of the <hi>Church</hi> is the truth of the <hi>Papiſts Church:</hi> for they ſpeak as if they were the only Chriſtians in the World before <hi>Luther;</hi> when the whole World knows, that this is but talk, and that there were other Chriſtians beſides the <hi>Papiſts</hi> that might have perpetuated the <hi>Church,</hi> tho there had not been then one <hi>Papiſt</hi> in being. For ſure there was a Catholick Church before the <hi>Roman</hi> one.</p>
                  <p>Next, the <hi>Papiſts</hi> ſay, To hold that the Viſible
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:47928:83"/> 
                     <hi>Church is not perpetual, is a Hereſie;</hi> ſo that <hi>Luther's</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation being but particular, and not univerſal, nor but of late date; it can have nothing to do with the viſible and perpetual Church. Which the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> anſwer thus. <hi>To ſay the viſible Church is not perpetual, is properly a Hereſie;</hi> but the <hi>Papiſts</hi> cannot deny, but that the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> who preach'd the <hi>Goſpel</hi> in the beginning, did believe the <hi>Church univerſal,</hi> tho their preaching at the beginning was not ſo. So <hi>Luther</hi> alſo might well believe the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Church,</hi> though his <hi>Reformation</hi> was but particular; the Church in the Apoſtles time being univerſal <hi>de jure</hi> of right, but not <hi>de facto</hi> in fact.</p>
                  <p>Nor did <hi>Luther</hi> and his followers (as the <hi>Papiſts</hi> are pleaſed to miſ-call many <hi>Proteſtants)</hi> forſake the whole Church, but the <hi>corruptions</hi> of it, in renouncing ſome of their corrupt practices; and this the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> ſay they did without <hi>Schiſm,</hi> becauſe they had cauſe to do it; and no man can have cauſe to be a <hi>Schiſmatick,</hi> becauſe he is only one who leaves the Church without a cauſe: for 'tis not only <hi>ſeparation,</hi> but a <hi>cauſeleſs ſeparation</hi> from the Church, that is <hi>Schiſmatical:</hi> and I think 'twill not be amiſs, before I go any farther, to diſtinguiſh the difference between <hi>Hereſie</hi> and <hi>Schiſm. Hereſie is an obſtinate defence of any error a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt any neceſſary Article of the Chriſtian Faith. Schiſm is a cauſeleſs ſeparation of one part of the Church from another.</hi> Now we <hi>Proteſtants</hi> ſay ſtill, That we never forſook the whole Church, or the external Communion of it, but only that part of it which is corrupted, and is to be fear'd will ſtill continue ſo, <hi>viz. The Papiſts Church;</hi> and forſook not, but only reformed another part, which part they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves were. And ſure the <hi>Papiſts</hi> will not ſay, the <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants</hi> forſook themſelves, nor their own Communion: and therefore the <hi>Papiſts</hi> Argument muſt be very weak, in urging that the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> joyned themſelves to no other part of the Church, therefore they muſt ſeparate from the whole Church; which the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> ſay is a falſe conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, in as much as they themſelves were part of it, and ſtill continue ſo; and therefore the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> could no more ſeparate from the whole, than from themſelves.</p>
                  <p>So that by the rule of <hi>Reaſon,</hi> if <hi>Proteſtants</hi> be <hi>Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,</hi>
                     <pb n="35" facs="tcp:47928:83"/> becauſe they differ from one part of the <hi>viſible Church;</hi> by the ſame reaſon the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> may ſay that the <hi>Roman Church</hi> is in a manner made up of <hi>Schiſmaticks:</hi> for the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> are Schiſmaticks from the <hi>Dominicans,</hi> and the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minicans</hi> from the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> and the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> from the <hi>Canoniſts;</hi> the <hi>Franciſcans</hi> from the <hi>Dominicans,</hi> and the <hi>Dominicans</hi> from the <hi>Franciſcans:</hi> for all theſe (as the world knows) differ in point of <hi>Doctrine,</hi> and betwixt them there is an <hi>ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reconcilable contradiction;</hi> and therefore one part muſt be in error. And if the <hi>Papiſts</hi> will but ſtand to juſtifie what they declare as truth, <hi>That every error againſt a revealed Truth is a Hereſie;</hi> they holding for certain as a revealed Truth, the Immaculate Conception of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> then conſequently the <hi>Dominicans</hi> that hold and declare it an error in Doctrine, muſt neceſſarily hold a Hereſie. Now it may be a fault to be in error, becauſe it many times pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from a fault; but ſure <hi>Proteſtants</hi> forſaking error, it cannot be a ſin, unleſs to be in error, be a Vertue: So hardly do <hi>Papiſts</hi> deal with us <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> as they will either damn us in making us follow their falſe opinions, or elſe brand us as <hi>Schiſmaticks</hi> for leaving them.</p>
                  <p>And yet the rational ſort of <hi>Papiſts</hi> can hardly deny, but the <hi>Proteſtant Religion</hi> muſt be a ſafer <hi>Religion</hi> than theirs, in <hi>worſhipping Pictures,</hi> in <hi>Invocating Saints</hi> and <hi>Angels;</hi> in <hi>denying the Lay-men</hi> the <hi>Communion in both kinds,</hi> as was commanded by our <hi>bleſſed Saviour; in celebrating</hi> their <hi>Church-Service in an unknown Tongue,</hi> which was condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by St. <hi>Paul;</hi> in <hi>adoring the Sacrament:</hi> and in <hi>all theſe</hi> a rational <hi>Papiſt</hi> cannot deny, but he is on the more danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſide, as to the committing of ſin; and the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> in the more ſecure way, as to the avoiding it.</p>
                  <p>For in all theſe things, if <hi>Proteſtants</hi> ſay true, the <hi>Papiſts</hi> do that which is impious; but on the other ſide, if the <hi>Papiſts</hi> were in the right, yet the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> might be ſecure enough too: for their fault would be only this, that they ſhould only not do ſome things which the <hi>Papiſts</hi> themſelves confeſs is not altogether neceſſary to be done.</p>
                  <p>And truly the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> are ſo Charitably civil, as only to ſay of <hi>Papiſts,</hi> as St. <hi>Austin</hi> did of the <hi>Donatists, That</hi>
                     <pb n="36" facs="tcp:47928:84"/> 
                     <hi>Catholicks approved the Doctrine of the</hi> Donatiſts, <hi>but abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red their Hereſie of Rebaptization.</hi> So <hi>Proteſtants</hi> approve the <hi>Fundamental</hi> and <hi>neceſſary Truths</hi> which the <hi>Papiſts</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, by which many good Souls among them may be ſaved; but abhor the many <hi>ſuperſtitions</hi> they uſe in their <hi>Religion.</hi> And ſuppoſing theſe <hi>Errors</hi> of the <hi>Popiſh Church</hi> were in themſelves not damnable, to them that believe as they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs; yet for us <hi>Proteſtants</hi> to profeſs what we do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, and eſteem thoſe as Divine Truths, which we believe not to be either Divine or true; would be doubtleſs dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable as to us: for 'tis certain, Two men may do the ſame thing, and it may be ſinful to one, and not to the other: as ſuppoſe a married Woman gives herſelf out to be a Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, and one knowing her Husband to be alive, marries her, doubtleſs his injoyment of her was adulterous: but a ſecond man comes, and after ſeeing her pretended Husband buried, marries her, and dies without the leaſt informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of her firſt Husbands being then alive; his ignorance ſure protected him from ſin, and the ſecond Husbands know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of the ſin he acted, condemned him of Adultery; &amp; tho his fault might be palliated with ſome excuſes, yet it can never be defended by any juſt Apoligy. And ſo tho we read in Scripture, that it was St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Judgment, that meat offered to Idols might lawfully be eaten; yet he ſays; <hi>if any ſhould eat it with a doubtful Conſcience, he ſhould ſin, and be condemned for ſo doing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And ſuppoſing we <hi>Proteſtants</hi> ought not to have forſook the <hi>Papiſts</hi> Church, for ſin, and errours, if ſhe had not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn'd and impoſed them on us; yet ſince ſhe does main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain them with ſuch obſtinacy, and impoſes them with ſuch tyranny, we ought certainly to ſay with St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and <hi>St. John, 'Tis better to forſake men than God;</hi> and leave the <hi>Popiſh Church-Communion,</hi> rather than commit or profeſs <hi>known errors</hi> as <hi>Divine Truths;</hi> for as the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel</hi> tells us, that to ſay <hi>The Lord hath ſaid ſo, when the Lord hath not ſaid ſo,</hi> is a high preſumption, and great ſin, be the matter never ſo ſmall; and therefore when St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpoke concerning Virgins abſtaining from <hi>marriage,</hi> he ſaid, <hi>He had no commandment of the Lord, but I declare my own judgment of it.</hi> Now if St. <hi>Paul</hi> had given this as God's
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:47928:84"/> command, ſurely we might have juſtly contradicted him, and made a diſtinction between <hi>Divine Revelation,</hi> and <hi>Humane Judgment.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So that for a <hi>Proteſtant</hi> to abide in the <hi>Communion</hi> of the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> is ſo far from ſecuring him from <hi>errour,</hi> as that if I or any <hi>Proteſtant</hi> ſhould continue in it, I am confident I could not be ſaved by it: and the reaſon is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the <hi>Papiſts</hi> will not admit of my Communion, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out profeſſing the entire Popiſh Doctrine to be true: and profeſs this I cannot, but I muſt perpetually exulce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate my Conſcience: &amp; tho the <hi>errours</hi> of the <hi>Roman Church</hi> were not in themſelves damnable, yet for me to reſiſt <hi>known Truths,</hi> and to continue in the <hi>Profeſſion of known er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours and falſhoods,</hi> is certainly a capital ſin, and of great affinity with the ſin which ſhall never be forgiven.</p>
                  <p>In ſhort, if the <hi>errours</hi> of the <hi>Roman Church</hi> did not warrant our departure, yet the tyrannous impoſition of them would be our ſufficient juſtification; for they force us either to forſake the <hi>Papiſts Communion,</hi> or profeſs as <hi>Goſpel-truths</hi> what our <hi>Conſcience</hi> aſſures us is very little a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kin to them: ſo that the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> were oblig'd to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake thoſe <hi>errours</hi> of the <hi>Popiſh Church,</hi> and not the <hi>Church,</hi> but the <hi>errours;</hi> and we <hi>Proteſtants</hi> did, and do ſtill conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue <hi>members</hi> of the <hi>Church;</hi> having only left what appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red moſt plain to us to be <hi>ſuperſtitious</hi> and <hi>impious.</hi> And we ſeparate no more from the <hi>Popiſh Church,</hi> thant ſhe has ſeparated from the <hi>Ancient Church:</hi> and indeed, to ſpeak properly, our difference is more againſt the <hi>Court,</hi> than <hi>Church of Rome;</hi> which has introduced ſo many new ceremonies and practiſes in the <hi>Popiſh Church,</hi> as was never heard nor practiſed in the <hi>Primitive Times:</hi> as for one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of a Thouſand, I might give you <hi>Their denying the Cup to the Laity,</hi> which was never practiſed in the Church a Thouſand years after our <hi>Saviour.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But becauſe the <hi>Papiſts</hi> brag ſo much of, and depend ſo entirely on the <hi>Infallibility</hi> of their Church, I ſhall paſs by their Out-works, and ſearch a little into this their Grand Fort, the <hi>Infallibility of their Church:</hi> for except they prove that, they prove nothing; but in proving that
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:47928:85"/> they prove all: and if the <hi>Papiſts</hi> could ſatisfie me either by <hi>Scripture</hi> or <hi>Reaſon,</hi> that their <hi>Church</hi> is <hi>infallible,</hi> I ſhould not only be of their Church to morrow, but repent I was not ſooner: but really by all that I ever heard or read for their making it good, I find cauſe only to admire their <hi>confidence,</hi> but not at all to eſteem their <hi>reaſons.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The cheif <hi>method</hi> they take, and <hi>degrees</hi> they uſe, to prove the <hi>Infallibility</hi> of their <hi>Church,</hi> are by <hi>whole-ſale</hi> theſe, Firſt, that St. <hi>Peter</hi> was <hi>head</hi> and <hi>cheif</hi> amongſt the <hi>Apoſtles;</hi> and there was given to him and his Succeſſors by our <hi>Saviour,</hi> Univerſal Authority over his Militent <hi>Church;</hi> That the <hi>Pope</hi> or <hi>Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> is St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Succeſſor, and has his <hi>Authority of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Biſhop;</hi> and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the <hi>Roman Church</hi> being built upon this <hi>Rock</hi> is <hi>infallible:</hi> all which I doubt not but to prove to be inconſiſtent with, and contradictory both to <hi>Scripture</hi> and <hi>Reaſon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As to the firſt point of St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s being Head of the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles,</hi> which the <hi>Papiſts</hi> all ſtile him, and ſay he was called from thence <hi>Cephas,</hi> which is derived from the <hi>Greek</hi> word <hi>Head:</hi> it is a moſt groſs miſtake; for <hi>Cephas</hi> is a <hi>Syriack</hi> word that ſignifies <hi>Stone;</hi> but this is only by the by. Now we <hi>Proteſtants</hi> ſay, tho we allow St. <hi>Peter</hi> might have <hi>primacy of Order,</hi> yet we cannot grant he had <hi>ſupremacy of power</hi> over the other <hi>Apoſtles;</hi> for ſure it cannot ſtand with the leaſt reaſon, that St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſhould have <hi>authority</hi> over all the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> and yet never act the leaſt <hi>authority</hi> over any one of them.</p>
                  <p>Nor is it reaſonable to believe, that St. <hi>Peter</hi> having <hi>au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority</hi> over all the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> for above 25 years together, ſhould never ſhew the leaſt power over any of them all that time, nor ſo much as receive the leſt ſubjection from them: ſure any one muſt think this as ſtrange, &amp; unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, as if a King of <hi>England</hi> for 25 years together ſhould not do one act of Regality among his Subjects, nor receive any one acknowledgment from them.</p>
                  <p>Nor ſure is it leſs ſtrange &amp; unreaſonable, that the <hi>Papiſts</hi> ſhould ſo many Ages after, know this ſo certainly as they pretend they do, and yet that the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> themſelves, after that theſe words were ſpoak in their hearing by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue whereof St. <hi>Peter</hi> is pretended to be made their <hi>head,</hi>
                     <pb n="39" facs="tcp:47928:85"/> ſhould ſtill be ſo ignorant of it, as to queſtion our <hi>Saviour, which of them ſhould be the greateſt?</hi> By which ſure we may rationally conclude, they did not then know; for if they did, their queſtion had been needleſs, and ſuperfluous, in deſiring to be taught, what they already knew.</p>
                  <p>And what yet appears more <hi>ſtrange</hi> than all, is, that our <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour</hi> ſhould not have helped them out of their <hi>error,</hi> by tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling them St. <hi>Peter</hi> was the man; but rather confirmed them in the contrary, by ſaying, <hi>The Kings of the Gentiles exerciſe Authority over them, but it ſhould not be ſo among them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And again, it is as <hi>ſtrange</hi> and <hi>unreaſonable,</hi> that St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſhould ſo far forget both St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and himſelf, as in men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning ſo often St. <hi>Peter,</hi> he ſhould ſtill do it without aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribing him any title of Honour: Nor does it ſtand with <hi>reaſon,</hi> that St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaking of the ſeveral <hi>degrees</hi> of men in the <hi>Church,</hi> ſhould omit giving St. <hi>Peter</hi> the higheſt, if it had been his due, but place him in the ſame <hi>rank</hi> and <hi>equipage</hi> with the reſt of the <hi>Apoſtles:</hi> for St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays <hi>God hath appointed</hi> (not firſt St. <hi>Peter,</hi> then the reſt of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles) but <hi>first Apoſtles, ſecondly Prophets;</hi> now certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly if <hi>Apostles</hi> were all firſt, that is, all equal, how could one be in greater power than the other?</p>
                  <p>But beſides all this, though we ſhould grant againſt all theſe probabilities, and many more, that <hi>Optatus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> meant that St. <hi>Peter</hi> was Head of the <hi>Apoſtles;</hi> yet ſure the <hi>Papists</hi> are ſtill very far from proving, the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> was to be ſo at all, much leſs by <hi>Divine right,</hi> Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor to St. <hi>Peter</hi> in his Headſhip and Authority. For what incongruity is there, if we ſay that <hi>Optatus</hi> might ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed St. <hi>Peter</hi> as his Heir and Succeſſor, in that part of his Government of that particular Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> (as ſure he did even whilſt St. <hi>Peter</hi> was living) and yet that neither he, nor any man was to ſucceed him in his <hi>Apostleſhip,</hi> nor in the <hi>Government of the Church <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal?</hi> as tho a Biſhop ſhould leave his Son Heir to all he died poſſeſſed of; I hope you will not conclude, therefore he muſt neceſſarily ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed him in the Biſhoprick he died ſeized of. The <hi>Apostles</hi> were men all called, and Divinely inſpired by the <hi>Holy Ghost;</hi> which was the immediate gift of <hi>God,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore could not be left as a Legary by man; for though it be
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:47928:86"/> in any mans power to leave his Eſtate, yet 'tis in no mans power to leave to his Son his acquir'd parts at his death. 'Tis further worth your obſerving, and ſpecial notice, that <hi>St. Peter</hi> himſelf and the reſt of the Apoſtles, by laying the Foundation of the <hi>Church,</hi> were to be themſelves the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of it; and are accordingly ſo called in <hi>Scripture.</hi> And therefore as in a building 'tis incongruous that foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations ſhould ſucceed foundations, ſo it may be in the <hi>Church,</hi> that Apoſtles ſhould ſucceed Apoſtles, the <hi>Church</hi> being built upon Apoſtles and Prophets.</p>
                  <p>Nor indeed does the grand argument of the <hi>Papiſts</hi> for their <hi>Pope,</hi> extend any further in reallity then the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular <hi>See</hi> of <hi>Rome:</hi> for thus goes their main argument: St. <hi>Peter</hi> was firſt Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Apoſtles did not <hi>then</hi> attribute to themſelves each one his particular <hi>Chair</hi> (underſtand in that City of <hi>Rome<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> for in other places, others had Chairs beſides <hi>St. Peter)</hi> and therefore, ſays the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts,</hi> he is a <hi>Schiſmatick</hi> who againſt that one ſingle <hi>Chair</hi> erects another: (underſtand ſtill in the ſame place) and this this the Ground and the Authority the <hi>Papiſts</hi> ſay the <hi>Pope</hi> has to be Succeſſor to St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and to exerciſe Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority over the Univerſal <hi>Church.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But ſure the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> urge more rationally, in arguing thus: That St. <hi>Peter</hi> wrote <hi>Two Catholick Epiſtles,</hi> in which he mentions his own departure; and writes to preſerve the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> in the <hi>Faith:</hi> but yet in neither of theſe <hi>Two Epiſtles</hi> does he commend the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> to the guidance &amp; authority to his pretended <hi>Succeſſor</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Rome;</hi> which ſure if St. <hi>Peter</hi> had intended, he would never have forgot to have named it.</p>
                  <p>And ſince the <hi>Papiſts</hi> ſo reverence and adore the <hi>Popes</hi> power, let us <hi>Proteſtants</hi> alſo admire his way and means of attaining this power: For though the <hi>Papiſts</hi> ſay, that as ſoon as he is made <hi>Pope,</hi> he has his authority immediately from <hi>Chriſt;</hi> yet at the very ſame time the <hi>Papiſts</hi> all know, that he cannot be made <hi>Pope,</hi> but by authority and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of the <hi>Cardinals;</hi> ſo that I am ſure by the very ſame reaſon, any man that is choſen a Magiſtrate in any Town under the <hi>Pope</hi>'s Territories, may claim his Authority as immediately received from <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as well as the <hi>Pope.</hi>
                     <pb n="41" facs="tcp:47928:86"/> And further, that the proving his being made <hi>Pope,</hi> does not render him <hi>infallible,</hi> I could give a hundred inſtances out of the Hiſtory of <hi>Popes,</hi> but that will not ſuit well with my deſigned brevity, but let's ask the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> if <hi>Liberius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> after Two years Baniſhment, did not by the ſollicitation of <hi>Fortunatianus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Aquileia,</hi> ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe to <hi>Hereſie,</hi> and conſequently could not be <hi>infallible.</hi> And though the <hi>Papiſts</hi> rely ſo much on the Authority of the Fathers, to ſupport and juſtifie the <hi>Infallibility</hi> of their <hi>Church;</hi> yet upon true Examination we ſhall find, they make no more for their Univerſal Biſhop, than St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s <hi>Two Catholick Epiſtles</hi> do.</p>
                  <p>And for their arguing out of St. <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s 55 <hi>Epiſtles,</hi> that ſure makes rather againſt, than for them; for there St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> writes to <hi>Cornelius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> but writes not ſo much to him, as of himſelf, who was Biſhop of <hi>Carthage,</hi> againſt whom a Faction of <hi>Schiſmaticks</hi> had ſet up another Biſhop. Now though the <hi>Papiſts</hi> ſay reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably, <hi>that 'tis a mark of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Biſhop, that other Biſhops ſhould make their Addreſſes unto the Biſhop of</hi> Rome; yet ſure 'twere better Reaſoning to conclude thus: If the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> had been acknowledged Univerſal Biſhop, and his Authority and Supremacy had been believ'd and own'd, ſure St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> had not been ſatisfied with only barely writing him his ſad ſtory, (for he did no more,) but doubtleſs would have made his complaint to him, and deſired and expected redreſs from him, as Univerſal Biſhop over the whole <hi>Catholick Church;</hi> but his not doing ſo, argued he eſteemed him Biſhop only of one <hi>Church.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And further, <hi>St. Cyprian,</hi> all know, did reſolutely op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a Decree of the <hi>Roman</hi> Biſhop, and all that adhered <gap reason="illegible: left margin cropped or obscured"

                  <p>So that upon the whole, I cannot without much wonder look on the <hi>Pope</hi>'s Confidence, and the <hi>Papists</hi> Credulity, in eſteeming the <hi>Pope</hi> or his <hi>Councils</hi> to be an <hi>infallible Guide:</hi> ſure either they never read what they ought to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, or elſe they will not believe what they read, though it be never ſo known a Truth, and worthy of belief: for if they did, they could never believe the <hi>Infallibility</hi> of the <hi>Popiſh Church,</hi> For indeed, if they would read the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Story, or, as I may well call it, the Civil Wars of the <hi>Popes,</hi> you ſhall find, as I ſaid before, Popes againſt Popes, Councils

                  <p>And to ſpeak the plain <hi>Truth,</hi> and in a word to unravel the real cauſe of the <hi>Grandure</hi> of the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> above all other <hi>Churches,</hi> is only this: <hi>Rome</hi> was the Imperial Town of the Empire, and its greatneſs was given by Men, and not God; and when afterwards <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> was the Imperial City, they Decreed that the Church of <hi>Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople</hi> ſhould have equal Priviledges and Dignities with that of <hi>Rome.</hi>

                  <p>And now to end this Diſcourſe, I deſire you will pleaſe to conſider this <hi>Concluſion,</hi> which is, that after all that the <hi>Papiſts</hi> have ſaid, be it never ſo much and mighty, <hi>to ſhew the Infallibility of their Church;</hi> I am verily perſwaded they cannot ſhew more, if ſo much, out of the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> for <hi>their Church,</hi> as the ſmalleſt Society of Chriſtians met to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in prayer, can for themſelves, <hi>that when two or three are met together in my name, I will be amongſt them, ſays the Lord:</hi> And now I have juſt done this ſmall Diſcourſe, and the Sun is juſt upon finiſhing this days viſit; I can very readily follow that holy advice of not <hi>letting it go down in my anger:</hi> (which I thank God I have to none living) and therefore am in ſo much <hi>Charity</hi> with the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> as to wiſh that neither <hi>they,</hi> nor <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> might waiſt their precious time in meer ſpeculative controverſies about words and ceremonies, which of themſelves will never carry us to Heaven; but that we may ſpend our time like wiſe Chriſtians in the ways and fear of God, which is the only beginning of wiſdom; and not conſume it in ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dying and maintaining of Diſputes and Factions; but if we muſt ſtill differ, let <hi>Proteſtants</hi> and <hi>Papiſts</hi> differ in O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions but as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and <hi>Cicero</hi> did, who, tho they were of differing Judgments touching the natures of <hi>Souls,</hi> yet both of them agreed in the main, that all men had <hi>Souls,</hi> and Souls of the ſame nature.</p>
                  <pb n="48" facs="tcp:47928:90"/>
                  <p> And as <hi>Phyſicians,</hi> though they diſpute, whether the <hi>Brain</hi> or the <hi>Heart</hi> be the principal part of a man, yet that all Men have <hi>Brains,</hi> and <hi>Heart,</hi> they ſufficiently agree in: So though <hi>Proteſtants</hi> eſteem one part of the <hi>Church-Doctrine,</hi> and <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts</hi> ſet a higher value on another part, yet the Soul of the <hi>Church</hi> may be in both of them: and though the <hi>Papiſts</hi> account that a neceſſary <hi>truth,</hi> which the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> account neither <hi>neceſſary,</hi> nor perhaps <hi>ture;</hi> yet in <hi>truth</hi> truly ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary they both agree, <hi>viz.</hi> The Apoſtles <hi>Creed,</hi> and that <hi>Faith, Hope,</hi> and <hi>Charity,</hi> are neceſſary to ſalvation. And laſtly, though <hi>Papiſts</hi> hold they may be juſtified by their Works, and <hi>Proteſtants</hi> hold none can be juſtified barely by them, (in regard of the Imperfections of their Works) yet on the other ſide, we ſo much agree with the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> as to eſteem none can be juſtified without them: for with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Repentance, and Charity, none can be good; they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing both like Health to our Bodies, the want of which is ſufficient to diſturb all other pleaſures.

                  <p>We cannot I think bring up the rear of theſe Chaſte ones with any other Perſon, fitter or more deſerving, than Madam <hi>Gilberta,</hi> commonly called Pope <hi>Joan,</hi> a ſtrapping Laſs indeed.

Well, what then? Why having loſt her belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:47928:107"/> Gallant ſhe trips away to <hi>Rome,</hi> and had made ſo great a Progreſs in all the Liberal Arts and Sciences, that ſhe was thought worthy, it ſeems, of a Cardinal's Cap, and at laſt of the Triple Crown, and for two years and a half behav'd her ſelf very notably, and wanted no Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication becoming the Papal Chair, but that of her Sex. Yet ſee how Murder will come out at laſt. Going in a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Proceſſion to the Church of St. <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Lateran,</hi> between <hi>Coloſſes</hi> and St. <hi>Clements,</hi> ſhe by the way, in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Street, was rid of her vicious Life and an infamous Burden both together; (a pretty teeming Prolifick Papeſs, this muſt needs be a Babe of Grace that her Holineſs was delivered of, and ſhe the Whore of <hi>Babylon</hi> in a double Senſe) and at the very place where this unlucky Accident hapned there was erected the <hi>Colonna infame,</hi> or infamous Pillar, (as they ever after called it) in memory of this Accident, to the end it might the better be tranſmitted to Poſterity; and out of a zealous Abhorrence of ſo black
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:47928:108"/> a Deed, her Succeſſors baulk that way in their uſual Proceſſions, and ſteer ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther courſe to this very day. But this is not all; to prevent ſuch Female Goſſips for the future from putting the like Tricks upon the Conclave of Cardinals, they prudently found out the Porphyry Chair, an infallible Invention to avoid ſuch groſs Miſtakes, to the Prejudice of Infallibility, and the Shame and Scandal of the <hi>Roman</hi> Religion. Thus far <hi>Plati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> in his Life of that Papeſs, who was a great Friend to Popes, wrote the Lives of Popes down to his time, was Secreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to a Pope, and dedicated his Book to a Pope; and indeed the Story were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt incredible had he not the Suffrage of fifty more of their own Authors to juſtifie his Writing upon this Subject, tho Card. <hi>Baronius</hi> leaves her out; of whom we may truly ſay, as <hi>Scaliger</hi> did, <hi>Facit Annales non ſcribit,</hi> He makes Chronicles, but writes them not.</p>
                  <p>But here will ariſe poſſibly a Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, How comes it to paſs that this Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyry Chair is now laid aſide? That's a

The manner of this helliſh and bloody Perſecution, was as you find it in this enſuing Relation. <hi>Catharina di Medici,</hi> the Daughter of Pope <hi>Clement</hi>'s Brother, and Mother to <hi>Charles</hi> the ninth, did Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern the Kingdom of <hi>France</hi> during the King's Minority, through the ſupine negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of <hi>Anthony</hi> King of <hi>Navarre,</hi> with
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:47928:121"/> whom the ſaid Queen's Mother was joyned in the office of Protectorſhip, contrary to the Salique Law, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies the Inheritance, or Adminiſtration of the Realm to the Spindle. And ſhe perſuaded her Son to this Maſſacre. It was very ſpeciouſly carryed on, and veil'd with pretences of the greateſt Ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty imaginable, and that was a Match be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Houſes of <hi>Valois</hi> and <hi>Bourbon,</hi> the King reſolving to beſtow his Siſter <hi>Margaret</hi> in marriage to Prince <hi>Henry,</hi> Son to <hi>Joan,</hi> Queen of <hi>Navarre,</hi> the former being a <hi>Romaniſt,</hi> the latter of the Religion. But before the Nuptials were Celebrated, the Queen of <hi>Navarre</hi> (being then at the Court of <hi>Paris,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding all things neceſſary for the wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding-Solemnity) was poiſon'd by <hi>Renat,</hi> an <hi>Italian,</hi> the King's Apothecary, with the venomous ſcent of a pair of perſum'd Gloves; by whoſe unnatural death, the Kingdom deſcended to the ſaid <hi>Henry,</hi> precontracted to the King's Siſter. Short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after the Marriage was ſolemniz'd with Royal Pomp and State in the chief Church
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:47928:122"/> at <hi>Paris,</hi> to the great joy of his Majeſty and all good Men; to this wedding the Grandees of the Proteſtant party were courteouſly invited, <hi>viz. Henry</hi> Prince of <hi>Conde, Gaſper de Coligni</hi> Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral of <hi>France,</hi> and Couſin to the King, <hi>Francis de Andelot,</hi> the Admiral's Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Captain of the Infantry, and other Princes and Nobles. And the Magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, Jollity, and Careſſes of Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment were ſo great as are not to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed. Nothing is ſeen but Banquets, Balls, Maſques, Stage-Plays, and ſuch kind of Divertiſments, all perſonated in the Night. And this was the reaſon the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral had a deſire to quit <hi>Paris,</hi> becauſe he could not have acceſſe to the King, who was altogether taken up and delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with theſe nocturnal Revels. But thoſe of the reformed Religion hearing of his purpoſe to depart, with all ſpeed delivered their Petitions to him for redreſs of Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances, begging of him not to quit the place till he had preſented them to the King, which he did on the 22<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt</hi> 1572, being the fifth day after the
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:47928:122"/> Marriage. Returning home about noon, a Harquebuzier ſhot the Admiral with a brace of Bullets through both the Armes, out of the Window of a near adjoyning Houſe; but the Villain made his eſcape, before they could reach the Houſe. The King was then at Tennis with the Duke, when one of the Admiral's Gentlemen acquainted him with the news; which he no ſooner heard, but he, with a ſeeming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly violent Tranſport of Paſſion, threw a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way his Racket, and retir'd to his Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle: as young as he was he made good uſe of the Motto of <hi>Lewis</hi> the 11<hi rend="sup">th</hi> his Predeceſſor, <hi>Qui neſcit diſſimulare, neſcit regnare.</hi> The King ſwears moſt deſperate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſeverely to revenge this injury; grants the Admiral a Guard at his requeſt, but ſuch a one as would be ſure to ruine ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than ſecure him: and <hi>Coſſin,</hi> Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of the Guards, was the Man that commanded them; a moſt Inveterate and Irreconcileable Enemy to the Admiral and his Party, and a faſt friend to the <hi>Guiſians.</hi> The Admiral hear's a noiſe and ratling of Armour, tho altogether
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:47928:123"/> undiſturb'd, having the King's Royal word for his ſecurity; Beſides, he reflect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the Oath for Peace publiquely and frequently ſworn by the King, his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren and Mother, the League with Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> the Articles with the Prince of <hi>Aurange</hi> to that purpoſe; the King's faith ingaged to the <hi>German</hi> Princes; ſome Towns taken in the low Countries by the King's order; his Siſters marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age celebrated but ſix days before (yet her Bridal Robes were ſtain'd and defil'd with innocent Blood) the judgment of foreign Princes, ſucceeding Poſterity; the honour and Faith of a Prince, and the violation of the Law of Nations; all theſe, one would think, might eaſily oblige a Man to beleive that it was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible he could ever aſſent to ſo out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious and monſtrous a Fact.</p>
                  <p>Well, notwithſtanding all thoſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtations, Promiſes, Oaths, and Vows, the Queen-Mother and the King had reſolv'd upon a general Maſſacre through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the City of <hi>Paris,</hi> and this bloody Butchery was to be executed on the 24<hi rend="sup">th</hi>
                     <pb n="59" facs="tcp:47928:123"/> of <hi>Auguſt</hi> being Sunday (no matter for that, the better day the better deed) and accordingly it was perform'd: for <hi>Coſſin</hi> firſt brake in, which the Admiral under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, caus'd thoſe few Servants that were with him to lift him out of his Bed, for he could not riſe without help, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo diſabled by his Wounds, and put on a Night-gown, deſiring them to make their eſcape, he himſelf reſolving to dy with an undaunted Courage and Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an-like Reſolution.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Aſſaſſines ſoon gain'd the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral's Chamber, broke open the doors, and <hi>Benveſe,</hi> a <hi>German</hi> Miſcreant, educated in the Houſe of the Duke of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> with <hi>Coſſin</hi> the <hi>Gaſcoign,</hi> and others, ruſh'd in with Swords, Targets, and Coats of Male. <hi>Benveſe</hi> preſenting his Sword to the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral, after he had firſt blaſphem'd God, ran him in the breaſt, and then cowardly ſtruck the aged Gentleman on the Head; <hi>Attin</hi> Shot him with a Piſtol, and <hi>Benveſe</hi> gave him the third Wound on the Thigh, and ſo he fell down Dead upon the Spot. The Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> that ſtaid in the
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:47928:124"/> Court call'd to him and bid him throw him out at the window, which he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly did. Then he commanded the ſign to be given by ringing the Tock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſein, or great Bell of the Palace, (which is never done but on extraordinary oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions:) the mark whereby the Murde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers were diſtinguiſhed was by a general conſent to be a white linnen Cloth tied about their Arm, and a white Croſs on their Caps. Then an <hi>Italian</hi> Souldier of Captain <hi>Lewis Gonzagua</hi>'s, Duke of <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,</hi> cut off the Admiral's Head, and ſent it to <hi>Rome,</hi> preſerv'd with Spices, to the Pope and Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain;</hi> others cut off his Hands, and ſome, void of all modeſty, his Privities. Then the rude Rabble, for three days together drew the dead Body, thus mangled and weltering in Gore, thorow the Streets, and afterwards out of the Town, to the common Gallows, and there hang'd it up by the Feet. In the <hi>interim</hi> the reſt brake into the other Chambers of the Houſe, and ſlaught'red all they met with; among others, there were two young Pages of
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:47928:124"/> honour, of noble Birth, Count <hi>Roch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foucaut,</hi> and young <hi>Theligius,</hi> who was Guilty of no other crime, but being the Admiral's Son in Law. So they ran about from morning till night, ranſack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing 400 Houſes, ſparing neither Age, nor Sex, and threw the Bodies out of the windows, ſo that the Streets were ſtrewed with murd'red Carcaſſes, and ran down with Blood.</p>
                  <p>The next day the Butchery was renewed, thoſe diſperate Villains ſtripping the dead Bodies of their Garments, and throwing them into the River of <hi>Sein.</hi> Nor was their Blood-thirſtineſs yet quenched, for Meſſengers were ſent Poſt to all Cities, commanding them to imitate <hi>Paris,</hi> and to kill all of the Religion. Many Women with Child, Ladies and Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>women, Advocates, Phyſicians, and other eminent Men of Learning and Piety; among the reſt <hi>Peter Ramus,</hi> and ſeveral Students, were aſſaſſinated, without Plea, Sentence or Condemnation. I muſt not omit one paſſage that deſerves a margi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Aſteriſm in blood, that is of <hi>Ma'ſſon</hi>
                     <pb n="62" facs="tcp:47928:125"/> 
                     <hi>de Rivers,</hi> a Paſtor, and the firſt that laid the foundation of the Proteſtant Church at <hi>Paris. Manſorel,</hi> a mortal Enemy of the Religion, as ſoon as the Slaughter was began in <hi>Paris,</hi> was ſent Poſt to <hi>Angiers</hi> to prevent the News of Maſſacre by others: as ſoon as he arriv'd there, he was conducted to <hi>Maſſon</hi>'s Houſe; in the very Entry he meets with his Wife and there ſaluted her very cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniouſly (a right <hi>Judas</hi> kiſs, for he came to betray her Maſter) he demanded where her Husband was, ſhe replied in the Garden, and being brought to him they mutually and lovingly (as to out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward appearance) embraced each other, <hi>Manſorel</hi> told him in plain terms, like a bloody Butcher, I am come hither by the King's command to kill you, as you may perceive by theſe Letters, producing his Dague ready charged. <hi>Maſſon</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd, I have committed no Crime; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, I beg the favour of a little time to call upon God and recommend my ſelf to his merciful hands. Which ſhort Oraiſon being ſoon concluded, he with
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:47928:125"/> a meek Chriſtian temper receiv'd his Death-Wound, being Shot through the Body; but to return to <hi>Paris.</hi> We left the Admiral's Body hang'd up; the <hi>Pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians</hi> went thither in great Multitudes, and the Queen Mother carried the King along with them and her other two Sons to glut their eyes with that barbarous Spectacle; but the next night the Body was convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed away, and interr'd, as 'tis conjectur'd. Their cruelty not being yet ſatiated, they bring ſome to publique Tryal, to efface the blot of diſhonour that might juſtly reflect upon the King; and there was a parcel of Judges call'd out for that very purpoſe, who made an Order that a man of Hay (ſince the Admiral's Body could not be found) ſhould be made, and be dragg'd by the <hi>Boureau</hi> through the Streets, in Effigie, which was according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly done, his Arms and Enſigns of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour broken, his Memory blaſted, his Caſtles and Farms razed to the ground, his Iſſue declar'd Ignoble, Infamous, and Inteſtate, and all the Trees in his Woods to be cut down, to the height of ſix Foot.</p>
                  <pb n="64" facs="tcp:47928:126"/>
                  <p> Thus in all Towns great Murthers were committed, but none more horrid or devilliſh than the Maſſacre at <hi>Lions, Mandolet</hi> being Governour. As ſoon as he received the Letters, he, by a Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet and Cryer, ſummoned thoſe of the Religion to appear before him, which they readily did. Then he committed them to ſeveral Priſons, and deſir'd the common Executioner to call ſome to his aſſiſtance, and to murther them in Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, but he refus'd it, ſaying, he execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Law on none but ſuch as were publickly condemned, (a goodly Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour indeed, more cruel than the common Hangman!) Upon this deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, he commanded the Garriſon Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the Caſtle to take upon them that worthy action, and they refus'd it like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, upon a punctilio of Honour, that they did not uſe to fight with naked men; but the Butchers and Water-men at laſt (verifying the old Saying, that they are <hi>peſſimum genus hominum)</hi> were the wretched Actors of his Bloody De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, committing unheard of Cruelties,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:47928:126"/> and ſporting with them in the midſt of their miſery. Inſomuch that the Blood which came out of the Goal, call'd the Arch-biſhop's Priſon, was ſeen in the day-time, to the horrour of the ſtanders by, to flow reaking hot in the Channels of the Streets, and ſo into the River of <hi>Seine.</hi> Thus for the ſpace of thirty days complete, there was no intermiſſion of Murther and Slaughter all over <hi>France,</hi> ſo that there were about 100000 Perſons ſlain.

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban</hi> the 8th liv'd the longeſt and died the richeſt of all the Popes; for he ſat in the Chair twenty years: a rare thing (for they uſually kick up their heels very ſuddenly, and the reaſon is this, if they ſhould live long they would do too much miſchief) tho none of them ever attain'd to the years of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> who, as they ſay, was Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> twenty five. This <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban</hi> was a very active Man, and did not only pry into the preſent Affairs of the Church, but with a retroſpect did rip up and dive into old matters; to which end and purpoſe he appointed a ſelect Committee to examine Accounts, and
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:47928:134"/> take cognizance of the Errors of his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſors; upon which occaſion this witty Paſquin was made at <hi>Rome;</hi> where there are the Statues of St. <hi>Peter</hi> and St. <hi>Paul</hi> erected upon a Bridge there directly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite one to the other, a merry wag had clapt a pair of Spurs upon St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s heels, and St. <hi>Paul</hi> is ſuppoſed to ſay to him, Whither ſo faſt in this riding poſture? who anſwers him; I apprehend there is great danger in my ſtay at <hi>Rome,</hi> by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of this new Commiſſion, for I fear they will queſtion me for denying my Maſter, therefore I'll poſt away to ſome other place of Safety; and truly Brother <hi>Peter,</hi> ſaid <hi>Paul,</hi> I intend not to ſtay long after you, for I have as much reaſon to ſuſpect that they will examine me for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuting Chriſtians before my Converſion.</p>
                  <p>Pope <hi>Zachary,</hi> when the trade of Church-merchandizes was very dead, and he had little or nothing to do, rather than he would be idle, wrote to Biſhop <hi>Boniface</hi> in <hi>Germany</hi> directions when to eat Bacon, and he did very well in't, whatſoever the prating Hugonot ſays to
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:47928:135"/> the contrary; tho he had done far better, in the Opinion of ſome of our modern Caſuiſts, if he had alſo given him ſome wholſom Inſtructions concerning the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducation of Eggs, that ſo the Prelate might have had a complete Diſh.</p>

                     <hi>Leo</hi> the tenth had an intention to create <hi>Raphael <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rbin,</hi> a mere Painter, Cardinal; And why might not a good Painter make a good Cardinal? but ſure it was not he who drew the Pictures of St. <hi>Peter</hi> and St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and made them ſo red-faced, that that he was reprov'd for it by ſome of the Conclave, becauſe the ignorant might be apt to judge them great Drinkers, to the ſcandal of Religion; but he ſoon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, that is your miſtake and not mine; for I made them ſo ruddy, becauſe I knew that if they were living they would bluſh for ſhame at the vicious lives of their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Succeſſors. Now what if it were the ſame Man? It was great and good Policie in the Pope, beyond the reach of a Proteſtant Noddle; for hereby he might oblige all of that Profeſſion, in hopes of the like Promotion, that when
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:47928:135"/> ever any of them for the future ſhould undertake to draw the Pourtraicture of any Saint whatſoever, he ſhould make them of a more pallid and ſober Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xion.

                     <p>This bloody Inquiſition had no Cloak to ſhrowd it's Tyranny, but pious fraud covered with Robes of Sanctity, erected in ſeveral Parts of <hi>Europe</hi> (but we will only mention that of the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> wherein the Cardinal was ſo much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd) was confirmed and ratified by Pope <hi>Sixtus</hi> the fourth.

<pb n="104" facs="tcp:47928:146"/> be heard but the cries of poor <hi>Orphans</hi> and Widows for their Parents and Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands, the Sons living a deplorable life in Woods, the Daughters and Virgins raviſhed and brutiſhly uſed, beyond all Modeſty; inſomuch that Cruelty in a Human ſhape could not have been more outragious and deſtructive, then theſe modern <hi>Pharaohs.</hi> The Duke <hi>d'Alva,</hi> that Spunge of <hi>Belgian</hi> blood, boaſted, that in ſix years he had diſpatch't to the other World by Courſe of Juſtice, at leaſt 18000 <hi>Belgians,</hi> and yet the Preſident of his Council ſaid, that he quite ſpoiled the <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therlanders</hi> with too much Clemency and Mercy; ſo that it might very well be ſaid of him, as it was once of the Roman Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour <hi>Caligula;</hi> that he never ſpared Man in his Rage. Nobility, Honor, Merit, Chaſtity, nor any Virtue, could priviledge the Poſſeſſors from the Wrack, Pulley, Gibbet, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the uſual Attendants of theſe diſtreſſed Souls, and conſtantly waited on their Hearſes. They were ſo rigorouſly us'd by theſe Lords Inquiſitors, that their very Thoughts muſt be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:47928:146"/> and ſtifled for fear of Diſcovery; (ſo that the Proverb fail'd here, Thoughts were not free) for fear of the ſame miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune of the Knight at <hi>Rome,</hi> who was executed for putting a Dream into Words; Nay, the Torments of ſome were warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings to all; witneſs the timorous temper of <hi>Sevilian,</hi> who had a fruitful Pear-tree growing in his Garden, and the Inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors requeſted ſome of that Fruit; but he for fear of diſpleaſing them, pluckt up the very Tree it ſelf by the Roots, and freely beſtow'd it on them, Fruit and Tree and all. I will conclude this Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragraph, with the ſaying of an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Knight, upon another occaſion; if all Cruelties were loſt, they might be found in this Inquiſition; and yet this was ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled, promoted, and principally managed by the Religious Clergy-man, Cardinal <hi>Granvil.</hi>

All which was done by the Inſtigation of this wicked and cruel Society. They perſwaded this Monſter, that the King intended to make War againſt the Pope, and that to make War againſt him, was a <hi>Theomachy,</hi> or open War with the Deity; and there was found about him a Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter with a Heart of Cotton hung about his Neck, which he ſhewed the <hi>Jeſuit D' Aubinie,</hi> who confeſſed him and the Knife, whereon was ingraven a Heart and a Croſs; and that which was one oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of this barbarous Fact, was, That theſe Perſons of the Popes Party had publiſhed throughout the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, that whoſoever ſhould ſerve <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> the Fourth in theſe Wars, tho he was their Lawful and undoubted King, could not avoid damnation.</p>

The <hi>Franciſcan</hi> walks a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout very diſconſolately; which the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewoman perceiving, ſent her Maid to him to know if he wanted any thing; ſhe came to him in the Court and asked him if he had occaſion for any thing that the Houſe could afford? and he ſaid, yes: and leading her into a bye Corner, took a Dagger out of his Sleeve and thruſt it into her Throat. In the <hi>interim,</hi> one of the Gentleman's Tenants came into the Court to bring his Landlord's Rent; who ſpying the <hi>Franciſcan,</hi> he embraced him very courteouſly: but the wicked Fryar, to requite his Kindneſs, ſtab'd him, and then lock'd up the Caſtle Gate.

<pb n="171" facs="tcp:47928:179"/> and if you give him the leaſt ſign I will cut your throat; the Gentleman ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching, asked the Friar whence he came, he ſaid from his own Houſe, where I left my Miſtriſs your Wife in health, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting you, and ſo he paſt on, but his Man called to her, thinking it had been Friar <hi>John,</hi> the <hi>Franciſcan</hi>'s old Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion; But ſhe durſt not give him a word, only a wink with a weeping Eye; the Fellow rides after his Maſter, and told him that Novice did reſemble his Miſtriſs: Go, ſaid he, thou talkeſt like a Fool; but the Servant was ſo diſſatisfied, that he went back, his Maſter ſtaying to know the iſſue; he calls out aloud, Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar <hi>John;</hi> whereat the <hi>Franciſcan</hi> fearing a Diſcovery, turned back upon him, and with a long quarter-ſtaff knock'd him off his Horſe, and when he was down, fell upon him and cut his throat, the Maſter ſeeing his Man fall, made up to them, which the Friar perceiving, beat him down, and fell upon him, but the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman being very ſtrong, graſped him in his Armes that he could do him no

                     <p>FRiar <hi>Lewis,</hi> about 100 years ago, made an abſolute Paction with the Devil, who appeared to him at <hi>Marſeilles</hi> in the ſhape of a Goat, aad promiſed him (I wonder the Friar had no more Wit than to believe him, ſince he was a Lyar from the beginning) the uninter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted enjoyment of any Woman what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, tho never ſo great a Beauty; or of any other Pleaſures for the term of 41 years complete, but the Devil was too cunning an Arithmetician for him, pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the unite before the tens, which amounted but to 14 years, (and this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Contract is to be ſeen to this day, with the Devil's Claw to it,) when the time was expir'd, the Friar was detected of Witchcraft and burnt; all the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren he had chriſtned during that dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Apprentiſhip of twice ſeven years, being rebaptized; and the Women he had abuſed were confined to a Nunnery by themſelves.</p>
                     <pb n="174" facs="tcp:47928:181"/>
                     <p> There was a cetain Prieſt of <hi>Savoy,</hi> who was Curate of the Village <hi>Feling,</hi> near <hi>Bonne,</hi> to whom his Pariſhioners reſorted in great flocks, to beg of him that he would allay a violent Tempeſt that then raged among them; for he had often made his brags he could do it, and that they need not fear either Thunder, Lightning, or any Tempeſt, ſo long as he continued among them. Well, to work my Conjurer goes, and mumbles over a great many Conjurations, which he had by roat, being only a Medley of horrible, terrible, hard words, as dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to the People as the Tempeſt it ſelf, (he being ſheltered all this while under a thick well-ſpread Tree, and held by four or five for fear of being blown away) but finding himſelf at a loſs in his Art, to mend the matter, pulled out his bread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en God, and ſaluted it in this irreverend manner, according to the harſh Dialect of his Country; <hi>Cour di, ſe te ne ple for que le Diablou, &amp;c.</hi> By God's heart, if thou be not ſtronger than the Devil, I'll throw thee into the dirt. And this
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:47928:181"/> did the buſineſs effectually. Avant there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all <hi>Agrippa's,</hi> and <hi>Merlins;</hi> let not <hi>Spanheim</hi> boaſt any more of her grand Wizard-Abbot, ſince <hi>Savoy</hi> hath clearly out-done her with a little Conjuring Curate.</p>
                     <p>In <hi>Savoy Anno</hi> 1358, ſeveral Prieſts were burnt for Incantations, and Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery, and one of them a notorious Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman in the Black-Art, was executed at <hi>Rolle,</hi> a Town four miles diſtant from <hi>Lauſana,</hi> who had been a Wizard or Sorcerer, as appeared by his own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, for four and twenty Years, and yet all this time ſung Maſs, and perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the office of a Prieſt, as religiouſly as the beſt Maſs-monger of them all; and that he might not ſuffer uncomfortably, and dye alone, his Whore was burnt with him for company; and 'twas but juſt, that ſhe who had been a long time Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partner with him in Pleaſure, ſhould at laſt be partaker with him in Pain; and it ſeems ſhe imployed her Talent ſo well, that ſhe grew Miſtriſs of the Trade too, and was ſo expert in it, that ſhe was
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:47928:182"/> found Guilty, and condemned as a Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cereſs. Thus theſe two Helliſh, but lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Mates to the very laſt embraced one another in the hot Flames, a juſt reward or guerdon of their fiery Luſt, and Helliſh practices of this nature for many years to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, formerly by them put in Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for which they were both in the end (as you have heard) executed.</p>

                     <p>THere is a known ſtory of <hi>Monſieur Prat,</hi> the Chancellor of <hi>Paris,</hi> a <hi>Reverendiſſimo,</hi> and grave Clergy-man in the time of <hi>Francis</hi> the Firſt, who had a Preſent ſent him by <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, King of <hi>England,</hi> with a Letter wherein there was this Expreſſion, <hi>Mitto tibi</hi> 12 <hi>Moloſſos,</hi> I ſend you twelve Maſtives; but the profoundly learned Chancellor, miſtook the meaning for a dozen of Mules, and being over confident of this Expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he went to the King, accompanied
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:47928:182"/> with an eminent Noble-man at Court, to intreat his Maſter to beſtow on him that Preſent, which the King of <hi>England</hi> had ſent him; but King <hi>Francis</hi> having heard nothing of it, commanded them to produce the Letter, that he might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſe it; and the rather, becauſe that Mules in <hi>England</hi> are as rarely ſeen as Coaches in <hi>Venice:</hi> But when his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty found out the groſs miſtake, the Chancellor was the ſole object of their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive Laughter; who, like a State-Tink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, to mend the matter, did excuſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with this kind of evaſion, That he miſunderſtood <hi>Moloſſos</hi> for <hi>Muletos,</hi> like an Aſs as he was, which latter miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>interpretation rendred his Lordſhip far more Ridiculous than the former.</p>
                     <p>We read of an aged Prieſt, who <note place="margin">R.

<pb n="178" facs="tcp:47928:183"/> have made him change his note, yet the Cuckow would not, for this very reaſon, becauſe he had uſed <hi>Mumpſimus</hi> theſe 30 Years, (the more Block-head He) and therefore he would not leave his old <hi>Mumpſimus,</hi> for their new fangled <hi>Sumpſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus;</hi> No not he, it was fitter for a young Novice of his Order, to follow the new Modes of refined modern Speech, and not for a Man of his Years and Gravity.

                     <p>NUN is a word derived from the <hi>Egyptian Nonna,</hi> of the ſame ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, and truly their Confinement would be no leſs than an <hi>Egyptian</hi> Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, but that their <hi>Pharaoh</hi> is ſomewhat indulgent to that Sex, and both their Task<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſters and Task very eaſie and delightful. They have ſeveral other denominations, as
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:47928:185"/> Religioſas, Devota's, Votreſſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and all originally derived from fine words, Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Devotion, Vows of Virginity, and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtity, and the like; but whether theſe are broken or kept, judge you by the ſequel.</p>
                     <p>They have adopted one name to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that diſcovers their Life and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation againſt their wills, and that is, <hi>Recluſes,</hi> which in its native and genu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine Signification, ſpeaks no more than to be ſet open, or left at their own liberty and diſpoſal; tho the Learned Patrons of that barbarous Age, wherein it was firſt ſtarted, miſtook the meaning for thoſe that are cloſely ſhut up, and incloſed within the round of a Religious Cloi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Joan</hi> Queen of <hi>Sweden,</hi> was the firſt Authreſs of thoſe Epicoene Monaſteries, as one fitly call's them, wherein Men and Women did cohabit and live together (very religiouſly and chaſtly no doubt of it) under one Roof; And here, forty to one elſe, the dull Hugonot will ask, why Nuns ſhould be lodged near the Friars? Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſoul, God-wot, there's a queſtion with
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:47928:186"/> all my heart; when every ingenious <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maniſt</hi> will ſoon choak him with this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, The reaſon is this, becauſe the Barn ought to be near the Threſhers.</p>
                     <p>Now if you ſcruple the truth of this Saying; <hi>Boccace</hi> will furniſh you with a Precedent to confirm it, and one that is very pertinent, and to the purpoſe. For he tells you of an Abbeſs in <hi>Lombardie,</hi> that roſe in great haſte from a jolly Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norite, who upon pretence of ſhriving her, took an occaſion to lye with her, and bedded her all that night, ſaw one of her Nuns at the ſame ſport with her Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramour; but the Reverend Governeſs ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king more haſte then good ſpeed, inſtead of her Veil clapt on the Friars Breeches, the points of them hanging down on each ſide, as ill luck would have it, and came to her chamber big with reproof, reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to nettle her for her Laſciviouſneſs, (ſee how old Vice corrects youthful Sin) when ſhe her ſelf was piping hot with the ſame wanton Conflict; but the poor Nun, being about to receive her <hi>Benedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite,</hi> by chance ſpied her Head geer, that
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:47928:186"/> prieſtly ornament, and ſaid, Madam, I beſeech you firſt tye your Coife, before you proceed any farther, and then I am content to receive patiently your ſharpeſt Reprehenſion; but the Abbeſſe finding her groſs miſtake, ſoon chang'd her mind, and went ſneaking away, without bidding her farewell, which ſhew'd very little breeding; but had her education been never ſo good, this unlucky Accident was enough to ſpoil it, that's the very truth of it. Surely my Paper would be of a more ruddy complexion than natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally it is, for bearing the Contents of this Story, but that I find the <hi>Italian</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb is like the Pope, infallible; which ſays, that Paper cannot bluſh. This Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry puts me in mind of <hi>Scoggin's</hi> wonder, who taking a Friar in bed with a Whore, cried out, a Miracle! a Miracle! Here is to be ſeen a Friar with four Legs.</p>
                     <p>The Author of the Anato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie <note place="margin">The Anatomy of the Engliſh Nunnery at <hi>Lisbon,</hi> writ by a young Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of that Covent.</note> of the Engliſh Nunnery at <hi>Lisbon</hi> who was once a Brother of that Society, tells us, as a Witneſs of their Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtity,
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:47928:187"/> that he could go directly to a Place in the Wall of their Covent, where he might pull out the bones of Legs and Arms of the poor innocent Baſtards, that have been both got and murther'd by that Common Society.</p>

                     <p>This verifies the old Proverb; There's cunning in dawbing. Nay, 'tis certain, that theſe Tricks have been us'd ſome Centuries of Years, or elſe Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> could never have found ſo many Bones of drowned Infants as he did: and that they were very numerous is no wonder, being found in ſo ſpatious a Place; for his Pond muſt needs be very large indeed, whoſe See is univerſal. <hi>Inter Coenandum hilares,</hi> was the old rule; and you'l find it obſerv'd among the Nuns of <hi>Lisbon,</hi> where this Story was related in their Covent, by one of that Society, to foſter her ghoſty Father, as pleaſant Table-talk, by one that had been formerly a Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber-maid
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:47928:187"/> forſooth, in the very houſe where the Comedy was really acted.</p>
                     <p>Father <hi>Strange,</hi> a young Jeſuit, who had been brought up in <hi>England,</hi> fell very ſick, the Air it ſeems of <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Valedolid</hi> in <hi>Spain</hi> being unhealthful, and diſagreeing with his Conſtitution; which made him beg leave of the Rector to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn into <hi>England,</hi> and 'twas obtain'd, in Order to the recovery of his health, and partly alſo for the converting, or rather perverting of Hereticks: where he no ſooner arriv'd, but he took up this Nun's Ladies Chamber for his Quarters, and in a ſmall time threw off his Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and grew very luſty; inſomuch that he had a great mind to be dabbling with that young Gentlewoman, his Siſter <hi>Anne's</hi> Miſtris; for that was her name, that made this relation. Mrs. <hi>Anne</hi> it ſeems was then ſitting at her Needle-Work, with her back to her Lady, and the brisk recover'd Jeſuit, who were by the fire ſide; and ſhe looking by chance in a great looking Glaſs that hung before her, ſpied the late ſick Jeſuit at work, and
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:47928:188"/> withall ſaw what pains he took to ſhrieve her Miſtriſs; but he found before he had ended his ſhrift, he was diſcover'd, and ſuſpecting the truth, that ſhe had ſeen all, he took her aſide, and told her, that he was a man, and Fleſh and Blood as well as others, was ſubject to ſuch failings, tho he had vowed Chaſtity; uſing all the Perſwaſions imaginable to win her to Secreſy; and the better to effect it, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed her, that if ſhe at any time ſtood in need of a Confeſſor to abſolve her for any of her ſweet Sins (as he call'd them) he would perform that Office, and her Penance ſhould not be grievous or burthenſome. This was undoubtedly enough to keep a ſhe Saint from tatling. Do but gheſs by this at the ſober Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation of a profeſs'd Nun; of the Jeſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it's Chaſtity in the Action, her modeſty in the Relation, who did not bluſh to tell this tale for her own and her Ghoſtly Fathers Recreation; who, like an old Fornicator, would report it with delight in his jovial humour, as he did to me (ſaid
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:47928:188"/> the Author) and one Father <hi>Vivian,</hi> a Friar of the ſame Houſe.</p>
                     <p>Nay, 'tis very frequent among them, for the Father Confeſſor to go alone into the Nuns Cloiſter, or Side, and continue there a whole day together, and Dine at their Table with them, and be every o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther day in their ſight, tho it be expreſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly againſt their Rules; and in the Cell, which is only for them at Confeſſion, they have a Grate, which is uſually taken down with a ſlight, through which the Holy Nuns paſs to his Bed by night; a cleanly conveyance for ſuch luſtful Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons: nor indeed can it well be expected to be otherwiſe, ſince they have ſuch Provocations to this Sin, as Pride, Eaſe, fulneſs of Bread, and abundance of all Things, and thoſe the beſt that can be had for Mony; for many times thoſe coſtly Viands which the Viceroy's Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyor will not meddle with, becauſe they they are ſo dear, the Caterer of ſuch Houſes will buy, tho never ſo unreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, which Proviſions are made for the ghoſtly Father's Table; and when they ſit at
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:47928:189"/> their Meals, ſing bawdy Songs, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcene Catches to pleaſe their Confeſſor, playing the moſt looſe and wanton Tunes upon Inſtruments, ſuch as would make a chaſte ear glow, and a modeſt Perſon colour at the hearing. And this is the conſtant practiſe of theſe Religious Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, whoſe Covent is made a meer Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thel-Houſe, daily practiſing ſuch laſcivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Actions as are ſcarce known or heard of in ſome common Stews.</p>
                     <p>But my Pen being tired with writing ſuch unheard of Villanies; take this for a Corollary to all the precedent Matter. If Blaſphemy, Treaſon, and Simony, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly countenanced, but daily practiſed and applauded as works mertorious, by a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſion call'd Religion be the way to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; if Maſſacres, Murders, and Aſſaſſina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions be pious and good Acts, and can help the Soul to everlaſting Felicity; If King-killing, depoſing of Emperours and Princes, be not only commendable, but works of Supererogation, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the means to obtain Salvation; If Sodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, Buggery, Inceſt, and all ſorts of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs,
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:47928:189"/> are not only allowable, but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferable in ſome Caſes to Chaſtity, and Matrimony; if theſe, or any of theſe Qualifications can bring us into the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions of immortal Bliſs and Happineſs; Then he is to blame that will live an Auſtere, Sober, Religious, and Godly Life, and much to blame if he turns not a Proſelyte, and imbrace the <hi>Roman</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, which is of ſo great a Latitude, as to allow what Morality, nay, Paganiſm it ſelf, abhors as Unnatural and Beſtial; therefore much more ſhould every Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, who pretends to Chriſtianity, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt and abominate ſuch a Religion, whoſe Tenets and Practiſes are ſo Helliſh and Damnable.</p>
